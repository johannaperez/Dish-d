Transfer to the bowl of your stand mixer.Fit your stand mixer with the whisk attachment.  Add palm sugar, applesauce, and almond milk.  Whisk on medium until combined and palm sugar has mostly dissolved.  Add in vanilla extract, espresso powder, and stevia. Mix for a few seconds.  Add egg and egg white and mix just until combined.Switch to the paddle attachment and add in dry ingredients.  Stir until just combined.  Use a rubber spatula to do any final mixing. Dont overmix.  Turn batter into prepared cake pan, level with your spatula, give the pan a few raps on the counter to collapse any air bubbles.   Bake for 20  25 minutes or until a toothpick tests clean.  The cake will pull slightly from the edges of the pan when its done.Before serving, drizzle chocolate cake with mixed berry coulis.Put all ingredients in your VitaMix.  Start on low, increase to Variable 10 then whirl on high for about a minute until all the seeds have been pureed.  If you dont have a VitaMix, use a food processor or blender.  You may need to push the coulis through a fine mesh strainer to remove the seeds."},{"vegetarian":false,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":true,"dairyFree":false,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":false,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":3,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":false,"servings":16,"preparationMinutes":25,"cookingMinutes":10,"sourceUrl":"http://www.BettyCrocker.com/recipes/grillside-guacamole/11fd65a0-c355-4391-83ff-30cdc21129ef","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/grillside-guacamole-171573","aggregateLikes":56,"extendedIngredients":[{"id":9037,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/avocado.jpg","name":"avocados","amount":2,"unit":"lb","unitShort":"lb","unitLong":"pounds","originalString":"4 ripe large avocados (about 2 lb) cut in half, pitted and peeled","metaInformation":["pitted","ripe","large","peeled","cut in half,  and "]},{"id":2047,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg","name":"coarse salt","amount":1,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoon","originalString":"1 teaspoon coarse (kosher or sea) salt","metaInformation":["(kosher or sea)"]},{"id":11165,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cilantro.png","name":"fresh cilantro","amount":0.25,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro","metaInformation":["fresh","chopped"]},{"id":11215,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg","name":"garlic","amount":1,"unit":"clove","unitShort":"clove","unitLong":"clove","originalString":"1 clove garlic, finely chopped","metaInformation":["finely chopped"]},{"id":1002014,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ground-cumin.jpg","name":"ground cumin","amount":0.5,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"1/2 teaspoon ground cumin","metaInformation":[]},{"id":11979,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/jalapeno-pepper.png","name":"jalapeno chiles","amount":2,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"2 jalapeño chiles (3 inch), cut lengthwise in half, seeded","metaInformation":["seeded","(3 inch)"]},{"id":9160,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/lime-juice.jpg","name":"lime juice","amount":2,"unit":"tablespoons","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoons","originalString":"2 tablespoons fresh lime juice","metaInformation":["fresh"]},{"id":10411529,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/plum-tomatoes.png","name":"plum tomatoes","amount":3,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"3 plum (Roma) tomatoes, cut lengthwise in half, seeded","metaInformation":["seeded","(Roma)"]},{"id":98973,"aisle":"Cheese","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cheddar-cheese.jpg","name":"Quesadilla Queso Cheese","amount":0.25,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"1/4 cup Queso Cotijo cheese, crumbled","metaInformation":["crumbled"]},{"id":11294,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sweet-onion.jpg","name":"sweet onion","amount":1,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"1 medium sweet onion, thinly sliced, cut in half","metaInformation":["medium","thinly sliced","cut in half"]}],"id":171573,"title":"Grillside Guacamole","readyInMinutes":35,"image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Grillside-Guacamole-171573.jpg","imageType":"jpg","cuisines":["mexican"],"instructions":"1                               Heat gas or charcoal grill.

In a separate bowl, whisk together the wet ingredients. Add the wet ingredients to the dry and stir until a sticky dough forms.Pour the oil into a large skillet or Dutch oven for frying, about 2 inches deep. Heat the oil to about 375 degrees or medium heat. You can test the oil by pouring a drop of water into the pan; if it sizzles across the top, it's ready.With floured hands, roll the dough into small balls, about 1½ inches in diameter. Drop the balls immediately into the oil (they start to lose their shape if you roll them ahead of time). The balls should start to puff out on the bottom and turn a golden brown color. If the tops of the donuts aren't covered with oil, flip the donut balls and fry for another 1-2 minutes. When the donuts are cooked through, remove them from the frying pan and place them on a plate lined with paper towels.When the donuts are dry to the touch, roll them in cinnamon sugar. These are best served fresh and warm, but they will also last for a day or two in an airtight container. This recipe makes about 20 donut balls."},{"vegetarian":true,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":false,"dairyFree":false,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":true,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":23,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":false,"servings":6,"sourceUrl":"http://smittenkitchen.com/2011/04/blackberry-and-coconut-macaroon-tart/","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/blackberry-and-coconut-macaroon-tart-50460","aggregateLikes":881,"creditText":"Smitten

heat. Cook onion for about 5 minutes until soft. Reduce heat to medium-low and continue cooking until golden brown. Season with salt. Set aside to cool.In a large bowl, mix flour with salt. Dissolve the fresh yeast in water and add to the flour mixture. Mix everything together then add caramelized onion and green onion leaves and knead until the dough is smooth and pulls away from the side of the bowl. Cover it and let it sit for about 1 hour at room temperature, to let the dough rise until doubled in size.Preheat oven to 240C (470F) 30 minutes before baking. Spoon 1 tablespoon flour into a small baking tray, put the dough in the tray and let sit until the oven is hot. Optional sprinkle salt and  few green onion chopped leaves on top. Put an empty baking pot in the oven ten minutes before baking. As you put the baking tray in the oven, add a cup of hot water in the empty pot, in this way it will instantly boil and create steam. Bake for about 25-30 minutes. Remove the bread from the baking tray and cool on a wire rack. "},{"vegetarian":true,"vegan":true,"glutenFree":false,"dairyFree":true,"veryHealthy":true,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":true,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":12,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":false,"servings":6,"sourceUrl":"http://www.vegetariantimes.com/recipe/white-bean-brussels-sprouts-and-pomegranate-tart/","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/white-bean-brussels-sprouts-and-pomegranate-tart-757951","aggregateLikes":800,"extendedIngredients":[{"id":11098,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brussels-sprouts.jpg","name":"brussels sprouts","amount":1,"unit":"lb","unitShort":"lb","unitLong":"pound","originalString":"1 lb.

Pat the chicken dry. Cut the chicken into 10 pieces instead of the usual 8. To create the extra two pieces, cut the breast off the backbone, and then cut each breast in half, which will give you two wings, two thighs, two legs, and four pieces of breast. (Editor’s Note: You really must partake of this nifty little trick.) Place the chicken pieces in a large bowl and season with the salt, pepper, cayenne, white pepper, garlic powder, and hot sauce, and toss to coat evenly. Cover with plastic and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to 1 day (the longer the better, to allow the seasonings to permeate the meat).2. Remove the chicken from the dry spices, allowing any liquid to drip back into the bowl, and place the chicken in a clean bowl. Pour the buttermilk over the chicken.3. Heat the lard, vegetable shortening, or bacon fat in a large cast-iron skillet to 350°F (176°C), or until a pinch of flour sizzles when it’s dropped in the fat.4. As the oil heats, remove the chicken from the buttermilk, allowing any excess liquid to drip off, and transfer the chicken to a clean bowl. Sprinkle with the flour and toss to coat.5. When the oil is ready, add the chicken pieces to the skillet in batches, shaking off any excess flour before adding them to the oil. Start with the larger bone-in cuts in the first round, as they will take longer to cook. Then fry the chicken breasts in the second round. For the crispiest results, it’s important not to overcrowd the pan. Fry the first batch of chicken about 8 minutes on each side, using tongs to turn it as necessary, making sure the oil does not get too hot. The oil should have a mellow sizzle, not a raging boil, or it will make the outside of the chicken too dark before the inside is cooked. Transfer the chicken to a plate lined with paper towels to soak up the excess oil. The breasts will take about 6 minutes on each side. Don’t be in such a rush to eat the chicken right out of the fat; it’s too hot, for one thing. And if you let it sit for a few minutes, the juices will settle and it will be more pleasurable to eat."},{"vegetarian":true,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":false,"dairyFree":false,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":true,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":5,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":false,"servings":10,"sourceUrl":"http://www.thecomfortofcooking.com/2013/01/fluffy-buttermilk-pancakes.html","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/fluffy-buttermilk-pancakes-590567","aggregateLikes":5993,"creditText":"The Comfort of Cooking","sourceName":"The Comfort of Cooking","extendedIngredients":[{"id":20081,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png","name":"all purpose flour","amount":1.25,"unit":"cups","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"1 1/4 cups all purpose flour","metaInformation":[]},{"id":18371,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg","name":"baking powder","amount":1,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoon","originalString":"1 heaping teaspoon baking powder","metaInformation":[]},{"id":18372,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg","name":"baking soda","amount":1,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoon","originalString":"1 teaspoon baking soda","metaInformation":[]},{"id":1230,"aisle":"Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/buttermilk.jpg","name":"buttermilk","amount":1.25,"unit":"cups","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"1 1/4 cups buttermilk","metaInformation":[]},{"id":4582,"aisle":"Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vegetable-oil.jpg","name":"canola oil","amount":0.25,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"1/4 cup vegetable or canola oil, plus 2 Tbsp. for pan","metaInformation":["for pan"]},{"id":1123,"aisle":"Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg","name":"egg","amount":1,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"1 large egg","metaInformation":["large"]},{"id":19335,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg","name":"granulated sugar","amount":0.25,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"1/4 cup granulated sugar","metaInformation":[]},{"id":2050,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla-extract.jpg","name":"vanilla extract","amount":0.5,"unit":"tsp","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"1/2 tsp. vanilla extract","metaInformation":[]}],"id":590567,"title":"Fluffy Buttermilk Pancakes","readyInMinutes":45,"image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Fluffy-Buttermilk-Pancakes-590567.jpg","imageType":"jpg","cuisines":[],"instructions":"In a large bowl, combine all ingredients and mix until smooth.

For larger profiteroles, pipe the paste into 1½-inch rounds, spacing 3 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets. For smaller profiteroles, pipe the paste into 1-inch rounds, about 1 inch in diameter, spacing 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets. To prevent the tops from burning, level the peaks with a wet fingertip.Bake one sheet of profiteroles at a time. Using a small spray bottle filled with water, lightly spritz the profiteroles with water and immediately place in the oven. The water will help to create steam, which helps give the profiteroles volume.Bake until tops and sides are golden, 25 to 30 minutes for larger profiteroles and 15 to 20 minutes for smaller ones. Turn off the oven and allow to rest in the oven for 5 minutes.Remove from the oven. Pierce each profiterole in the side with a small paring knife to allow steam to escape. Transfer to a wire rack and allow to cool completely.With a serrated knife, cut each profiterole in half crosswise.Transfer the chantilly cream to a large piping bag fitted with a large tip (like a Wilton 1M). Pipe the cream in a decorative swirl on the bottom half of each profiteroles. Replace the tops.To serve, dust with confectioners’ sugar. If not serving immediately, filled profiteroles can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to two hours (any longer could cause the pastry to go soggy).Combine the cream and the vanilla bean and seeds in an airtight container. Stir to combine. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour, or preferably 24 hours, to allow the vanilla to infuse.At least 30 minutes before whipping the cream, put the bowl and whip attachment of a stand mixer in the freezer. Just prior to whipping, remove the vanilla cream from the refrigerator and strain through a fine-mesh sieve into the cold bowl (discard the solids).Fit the mixer with the whip attachment and begin beating the cream at high speed (to immediately incorporate air) until soft peaks (curl when attachment is lifted) form, about 2 minutes. Reduce the speed to low and gradually add the confectioners’ sugar. Increase the speed to high and continue beating to stiff peaks (stand up straight when attachment is lifted), about 2 minutes longer.If not using immediately, transfer to an airtight container and refrigerator until ready to use, no longer than 3 hours.In a medium saucepan, bring the water, butter, sugar, and salt to a rolling boil over medium-high heat, stirring gently with a wooden spoon.When the mixture begins to boil, add the flour all at once and stir vigorously until the paste reaches an internal temperature of 175°F (80°C), pulls away from the sides of the pan, and forms a ball, about 1 minute. Remove from the heat.Allow the paste to cool, stirring a couple of times, to a temperature of 120°F (50°C), about 2 minutes.Add the eggs one at a time, making sure each egg is well incorporated before adding the next, stirring vigorously until well combined and the paste is smooth."},{"vegetarian":false,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":false,"dairyFree":false,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":true,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":27,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":false,"servings":8,"preparationMinutes":30,"cookingMinutes":20,"sourceUrl":"http://boulderlocavore.com/2012/11/italian-chestnut-crepes-with-nutella-cream-filling-gluten-free.html","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/italian-chestnut-crepes-with-nutella-cream-filling-gluten-free-522037","aggregateLikes":1790,"creditText":"Boulder Locavore","sourceName":"Boulder Locavore","extendedIngredients":[{"id":10020129,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png","name":"cake flour blend","amount":1.3333333333333333,"unit":"cups","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"1 1/3 cups All Purpose Gluten Free flour blend (I used King Arthur GF Blend)","metaInformation":["gluten free","(I used King Arthur GF Blend)"]},{"id":99016,"aisle":"Gourmet","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png","name":"chestnut flour","amount":0.6666666666666666,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"2/3 cup Chestnut Flour","metaInformation":[]},{"id":1123,"aisle":"Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg","name":"eggs","amount":2,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"2 Eggs, room temperature","metaInformation":["room temperature"]},{"id":2010,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cinnamon.jpg","name":"ground cinnamon","amount":0.25,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"¼ teaspoon ground Cinnamon","metaInformation":[]},{"id":1053,"aisle":"Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/fluid-cream.jpg","name":"heavy whipping cream","amount":2,"unit":"cups","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"2 cups heavy Whipping Cream (plus additional whipping cream for topping the crepes)","metaInformation":["for topping the crepes)"]},{"id":1082047,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg","name":"kosher salt","amount":0.25,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"¼ teaspoon Kosher Salt","metaInformation":[]},{"id":19125,"aisle":"Nut butters, Jams, and Honey","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/hazelnut-chocolate-spread.jpg","name":"nutella","amount":1,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cup","originalString":"1 cup Nutella","metaInformation":[]},{"id":1145,"aisle":"Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg","name":"unsalted butter","amount":1,"unit":"tablespoon","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoon","originalString":"1 tablespoon unsalted Butter, melted","metaInformation":["unsalted","melted"]},{"id":14412,"aisle":"Beverages","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/water.jpg","name":"water","amount":1,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cup","originalString":"1 cup Water","metaInformation":[]},{"id":1077,"aisle":"Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/milk.jpg","name":"whole milk","amount":1,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cup","originalString":"1 cup Whole Milk","metaInformation":["whole"]}],"id":522037,"title":"Italian Chestnut Crepes with Nutella Cream filling {gluten free}","readyInMinutes":50,"image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Italian-Chestnut-Crepes-with-Nutella-Cream-filling-{gluten-free}-522037.jpg","imageType":"jpg","cuisines":["mediterranean","european","italian"],"instructions":"In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flours, milk, water, eggs, butter, salt and cinnamon.

In a frying pan over medium-high to high heat, heat about an inch of canola or vegetable oil. Fry each slice of pork until just barely golden brown around the edges, about 1-2 minutes, flipping halfway through. If they are thin enough, this will be enough to cook them fully. Lay them between sheets of paper towel on a plate to catch excess oil.4. Cut each of the pork slices in half and place them back in the pot with the onions. Add enough water to the pot to cover the pork and onions. Cover pot and simmer on medium heat for 45 minutes to 1 hour. Stir occasionally.5.

Cake","readyInMinutes":45,"image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/caramel-apple-bundt-cake-569353.jpg","imageType":"jpg","cuisines":[],"instructions":"Generously grease and flour a 9 or 10-inch bundt pan. Set aside. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, soda, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt. Set aside. Peel, core and dice 3 cups of apples. Toss the apples with the tablespoon of lemon juice to keep from browning. Add the dark brown sugar and 1 teaspoon vanilla and toss to combine. Set aside.Using a handheld electric mixer or in the bowl of a stand mixer, blend the oil, sugar, and vanilla until well mixed. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in the dry ingredients until just incorporated. The batter will be quite thick. Drain any excess liquid from the apples (if any) and stir the apple mixture into the batter. Don't overmix! Pour the batter evenly into the prepared pan.In a medium bowl, beat the cream cheese just until smooth. Add the 1/3 cup sugar, vanilla and egg and beat on medium speed until creamy and smooth.Using a spoon or butter knife, make a trench in the center of the cake batter (going around in the circular shape of the bundt pan) about 1-inch deep (just scoop the excess batter to either side. Spoon the cream cheese mixture into the trench. Try and keep the cream cheese mixture in a ring in the center of the cake so it has cake batter on either side around the circle. Once the cream cheese mixture is in place, use a butter knife to swirl the cream cheese mixture into the surrounding cake batter.Bake the cake for 1 hour and 15 minutes (checking often as you may need to decrease or increase time based on your pan and exact oven temperature). Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out with only a few moist crumbs.While the cake is cooling, mix the ingredients for the glaze in a small pan over medium high heat. Allow the ingredients to come to a boil and boil for one minute, stirring constantly. Pour the glaze over the cake while the cake is still in the pan. Let the cake cool in the pan before removing. Turn the cake out onto a serving plate and store covered in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. Serve chilled or at room temperature, drizzling caramel sauce over each piece.For the caramel sauce, mix the butter, brown sugar, half-and-half or cream, and salt in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook while whisking gently for 5 to 7 minutes, until thickened slightly. Add the vanilla and cook another minute to thicken further. Turn off the heat and pour the sauce into a jar. Refrigerate until cold (or use slightly warm but not hot). If the caramel sauce has cooled in the fridge long enough to harden, warm slightly before drizzling on cake."},{"vegetarian":false,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":false,"dairyFree":true,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":false,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":30,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":false,"servings":4,"preparationMinutes":150,"cookingMinutes":90,"sourceUrl":"http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchens/beer-brined-beer-can-chicken.html","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/beer-brined-beer-can-chicken-743696","aggregateLikes":355,"creditText":"Foodnetwork","sourceName":"Foodnetwork","extendedIngredients":[{"id":14006,"aisle":"Alcoholic

                                         Make the brine: Combine the beer, brown sugar, salt, orange zest, orange juice and cardamom pods in a bowl; stir until the sugar and salt dissolve.Put the chicken in a gallon-size resealable plastic bag and add the brine; seal and refrigerate 2 hours.Prepare the grill: For a charcoal grill, pile 3 to 4 pounds briquettes in the grill; ignite and let burn until the coals are ashy. For a gas grill, preheat to high.Prepare the chicken: Remove from the brine and pat dry; reserve the orange zest and cardamom. Rub the olive oil all over the skin. Loosen the skin on the breasts and legs with your fingers; rub 1 garlic clove under and over the skin. Combine the brown sugar, coriander, cumin, paprika, allspice, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and a few grinds of pepper; rub under and over the skin of the chicken and inside the cavity.Pour half of the remaining beer can into a disposable 8-inch-square pan. Add the reserved orange zest to the pan. Poke 3 or 4 holes into the top sides of the beer can using a paring knife. Add the remaining 3 smashed garlic cloves and the reserved cardamom pods to the can.For a charcoal grill, bank the coals to both sides in two piles; nestle the pan with the beer between the coals and replace the top grill grate. For a gas grill, reduce the heat to medium on one side and turn off the burners on the other; place the pan under the grate on the unlit side.Set the chicken over the beer can, inserting the can into the cavity so 1 inch of the can is exposed. Set on the grill grates over the drip pan so the chicken balances on the can and legs like a tripod. Cover the grill and cook until the chicken is golden brown and a thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh registers 165 degrees F. If using charcoal, this will take about 1 hour 20 minutes; add a handful of briquettes to each bank of coals every 30 minutes to maintain the heat. If using gas, it will take about 1 hour 5 minutes; carefully rotate the chicken halfway through.Remove the chicken from the grill, discard the can and transfer to a cutting board; let rest 10 minutes before carving.Photograph by Con Poulos                                                    Recipe courtesy of Food Network Magazine                         CATEGORIES:

I do that by adding the eggs to cold water, heating them over medium heat and gradually increasing it to high heat. Once boiling, I boil the eggs for 2 minutes, then I remove them from the heat, cover the pot and let it sit for 10 minutes. I then run the eggs under cold water for a few minutes and let them soak in the cold water until ready to peel.Heat a large skillet over medium heat and add bacon. I think bacon is best when cooked over medium-low heat, as it crisps up evenly. Cook the bacon until all the fat is rendered and then turn off the heat. Place the bacon on a paper towel to slightly drain and cool. Gently pour the bacon fat into a bowl or cup. To assemble the salads, pile your spinach on a plate and cover with the sliced hard boiled eggs, avocado and gorgonzola. Crumble on two slices of bacon and season with a bit of pepper if you'd like. I find that this salad doesn't need a lot of salt since the components are so salty.hot bacon dressingAdd the bacon grease, , minced garlic, vinegar, sugar and mustard to a saucepan over medium-low heat. Whisk constantly until the sugar has dissolved and the dressing slightly emulsifies. Season with the salt and pepper. Before serving, add in the crumbled bacon. You can keep this over low heat while stirring occasionally until ready to serve. I suggest reheating it in a saucepan like so. This is the combo I've come to love over the years, but you can experiment with different vinegars, more bacon fat and other spices too!"},{"vegetarian":false,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":true,"dairyFree":false,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":true,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":9,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":false,"servings":25,"preparationMinutes":10,"cookingMinutes":30,"sourceUrl":"http://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/pumpkin-gingerbread-trifle","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/pumpkin-gingerbread-trifle-367875","aggregateLikes":1053,"creditText":"Taste of Home","sourceName":"Taste of Home","extendedIngredients":[{"id":19334,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-sugar-dark.jpg","name":"brown sugar","amount":0.5,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"1/2 cup packed brown sugar","metaInformation":["packed"]},{"id":18010,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-flour.jpg","name":"cake mix","amount":28,"unit":"ounces","unitShort":"oz","unitLong":"ounces","originalString":"2 packages (14-1/2 ounces each) gingerbread cake mix","metaInformation":[]},{"id":1077,"aisle":"Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/milk.jpg","name":"milk","amount":3,"unit":"cups","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"3 cups 2% milk","metaInformation":["2%"]},{"id":11424,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pumpkin-puree.jpg","name":"solid pack pumpkin","amount":29,"unit":"ounces","unitShort":"oz","unitLong":"ounces","originalString":"1 can (29 ounces) solid-pack pumpkin","metaInformation":["canned"]},{"id":19206,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/instant-vanilla-pudding.jpg","name":"vanilla pudding mix","amount":4.6,"unit":"ounces","unitShort":"oz","unitLong":"ounces","originalString":"1 package (4.6 ounces) cook-and-serve vanilla pudding mix","metaInformation":[]},{"id":42135,"aisle":"Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/whipped-cream.jpg","name":"whipped topping","amount":12,"unit":"ounces","unitShort":"oz","unitLong":"ounces","originalString":"1 carton (12 ounces) frozen whipped topping, thawed, divided","metaInformation":["frozen","divided","thawed"]}],"id":367875,"title":"Pumpkin Gingerbread Trifle","readyInMinutes":40,"image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Pumpkin-Gingerbread-Trifle-367875.jpg","imageType":"jpg","cuisines":["european","english","british","scottish"],"instructions":"Directions                                                                                Prepare and bake gingerbread according to package directions, using two greased 9-in. round baking pans.

                  Combine the cream cheese, mayonnaise and blue cheese in a small saucepan. Cook over medium heat until smooth, stirring frequently, about 3 minutes. Set aside to cool slightly, about 5 minutes, and then stir in the celery.Heat the butter in a large skillet over medium heat until melted. Add the hot dogs and cook until heated through, stirring occasionally, 5 minutes. Stir in the hot sauce and cook until the hot dogs are coated, 1 to 2 minutes.Slice vertically through each potato bun, about halfway through so it resembles a top-split hot dog bun, and place 2 buffalo dogs in each. Top with 1 to 2 teaspoons of the blue cheese sauce, a drizzle of hot sauce (as spicy as you like it), some red onions and crushed blue chips.Serve the sliders with any extra blue cheese sauce and celery sticks on the side for dipping.

Pour the liquid mixture over the chicken and stir just a bit so the chicken is completely covered. Cook on low for 2 1/2 hours; stirring twice during the cooking time. (Depending on your slow cooker, you may need to cook shorter or longer. Check your chicken for doneness at the two hour mark.)3. When chicken is no longer pink in the center, it's done. Stir in butter until completely melted. Season to taste with salt. Serve over rice with naan."},{"vegetarian":true,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":false,"dairyFree":false,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":false,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":25,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":false,"servings":6,"preparationMinutes":300,"cookingMinutes":18,"sourceUrl":"http://thebakingpan.com/recipes/cookie/cornmeal-cookies/","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/cornmeal-cookies-672302","aggregateLikes":74,"creditText":"The Baking Pan","sourceName":"The Baking Pan","extendedIngredients":[{"id":19336,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/powdered-sugar.jpg","name":"confectioners' sugar","amount":1,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cup","originalString":"1 cup confectioners' (powdered) sugar","metaInformation":["(powdered)"]},{"id":9085,"aisle":"Dried Fruits","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/blueberries-dried.jpg","name":"currants","amount":0.25,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"¼ cup currants","metaInformation":[]},{"id":9079,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/dried-cranberries.jpg","name":"dried cranberries","amount":0.5,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"½ cup dried cranberries","metaInformation":["dried"]},{"id":20081,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png","name":"flour","amount":2.25,"unit":"cups","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"2¼ cups all-purpose flour","metaInformation":["all-purpose"]},{"id":9297,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/golden-raisins.jpg","name":"golden raisins","amount":0.5,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"½ cup golden raisins","metaInformation":[]},{"id":2047,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg","name":"salt","amount":0.5,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"½ teaspoon salt","metaInformation":[]},{"id":19908,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/unprocessed-brown-sugar.png","name":"turbinado sugar","amount":2,"unit":"tablespoons","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoons","originalString":"About 2 tablespoons turbinado sugar (for sprinkling)","metaInformation":["(for sprinkling)"]},{"id":1145,"aisle":"Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg","name":"unsalted butter","amount":1,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cup","originalString":"1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature","metaInformation":["unsalted","room temperature","(2 sticks)"]},{"id":35137,"aisle":"Ethnic Foods","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cornmeal.jpg","name":"yellow cornmeal","amount":0.5,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"½ cup yellow cornmeal, divided","metaInformation":["yellow","divided"]}],"id":672302,"title":"Cornmeal Cookies","readyInMinutes":318,"image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/cornmeal-cookies-672302.jpg","imageType":"jpg","cuisines":[],"instructions":"In a medium mixing bowl, combine flour,  cup cornmeal, and salt; sift or whisk together to mix. Set aside.In a large bowl of an electric mixer, add the butter and beat on medium speed until smooth and creamy, about 1 minute. Gradually add confectioners sugar, taking about 1 minute, then beat for about 1 to 2 minutes longer to thoroughly combine. While adding the sugar, stop the mixer if necessary to scrape the mixture off the paddle and scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula so the mixture blends evenly.Reduce the speed to low, and add the flour mixture in 3 to 4 additions, and mix just until thoroughly incorporated. The dough will be stiff and may seem crumbly.Add the raisins, cranberries, and currants. Beat on low speed just until incorporated.Divide dough in half. On a large piece of wax or parchment paper, shape each half into a round or square log, about 10 inches long and 1 inches in diameter. Sprinkle the remaining  cup cornmeal onto the logs and press the cornmeal gently into the dough, coating the entire outsides with cornmeal.Wrap each log in plastic wrap and refrigerate until well chilled, at least 4 hours or overnight.Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Baking sheets may be ungreased, lined with parchment paper, or lined with a non-stick baking mat.Slice chilled dough logs into  inch slices and place 1 inch apart on baking sheets. Sprinkle each cookie with a little turbinado sugar. Return remaining dough to refrigerator until ready to use. Tip: My favorite tool to cut refrigerator cookies is a stainless steel dough scraper; simply push the dough scraper straight down into the cookie for straight cuts. Or use a small kitchen knife to slice the cookies.Bake: Bake 16 to 18 minutes or until cookies are a light golden brown on the edges, but the centers are barely colored. Remove cookies from baking sheets with a metal spatula and place on a wire cooling rack to cool."},{"vegetarian":false,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":false,"dairyFree":false,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":false,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":13,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":false,"servings":8,"sourceUrl":"http://cookiemonstercooking.com/2014/06/30/berry-chocolate-chip-mascarpone-tart/","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/berry-chocolate-chip-mascarpone-tart-602857","aggregateLikes":41,"creditText":"Cookie Monster Cooking","sourceName":"Cookie Monster Cooking","extendedIngredients":[{"id":9050,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/blueberries.jpg","name":"blueberries","amount":0.5,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"½ cup fresh blueberries","metaInformation":["fresh"]},{"id":10019146,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chocolate-chips.jpg","name":"chocolate chips","amount":0.5,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"½ cup mini chocolate chips","metaInformation":["mini"]},{"id":1125,"aisle":"Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/hard-boiled-egg.jpg","name":"egg yolk","amount":1,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"1 large egg yolk","metaInformation":["large"]},{"id":20081,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png","name":"flour","amount":1.25,"unit":"cups","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour","metaInformation":["all-purpose"]},{"id":1053,"aisle":"Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/fluid-cream.jpg","name":"heavy cream","amount":1,"unit":"tablespoon","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoon","originalString":"1 tablespoon heavy cream","metaInformation":[]},{"id":19296,"aisle":"Nut butters, Jams, and Honey","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/honey.jpg","name":"honey","amount":1,"unit":"tablespoon","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoon","originalString":"1 tablespoon honey","metaInformation":[]},{"id":93820,"aisle":"Cheese","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-cream-fluffy.jpg","name":"mascarpone","amount":4,"unit":"ounces","unitShort":"oz","unitLong":"ounces","originalString":"4 ounces mascarpone","metaInformation":[]},{"id":1012047,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg","name":"sea salt","amount":0.25,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"¼ teaspoon sea salt","metaInformation":[]},{"id":9316,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/strawberries.png","name":"strawberries","amount":1,"unit":"cups","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cup","originalString":"1 to 1 ½ cups sliced fresh strawberries","metaInformation":["fresh","sliced"]},{"id":1145,"aisle":"Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg","name":"unsalted butter","amount":8,"unit":"tablespoons","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoons","originalString":"8 tablespoons (1 stick) cold unsalted butter, cut into ½ inch chunks","metaInformation":["unsalted","cold","cut into ½ inch chunks","(1 stick)"]},{"id":2050,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla-extract.jpg","name":"vanilla extract","amount":0.5,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"½ teaspoon vanilla extract","metaInformation":[]}],"id":602857,"title":"Berry Chocolate Chip Mascarpone Tart","readyInMinutes":45,"image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Berry-Chocolate-Chip-Mascarpone-Tart-602857.jpg","imageType":"jpg","cuisines":[],"instructions":"To make the crust - in a small bowl, whisk together the egg yolk, cream and vanilla.  Set aside.  Add the flour, sugar and salt to the bowl of a food processor.  Pulse a few times to combine.  Add the butter chunks to the food processor and pulse until it resembles coarse meal (and the butter is in even-sized pieces).  Add in the egg mixture and process until the dough just comes together (it should be evenly moistened and clumps together a bit).  Dump the dough onto a piece of plastic wrap and use your hands to pat it together and form into a disc, about 6 inches wide.  Wrap tightly and transfer to the refrigerator for about 1 hour, until firm.On a floured piece of parchment paper, roll out the dough into a circle about 13 inches wide.  If the dough is too sticky, refrigerate until it firms up.  Transfer the dough to a fluted 9-inch tart pan with a removable bottom and press into the edges to fill the sides (if any part of the crust is too thin, use the extra from the top to reinforce the sides).  Remove any excess dough from the top.  Set the pan on a plate or small baking sheet and transfer to the freezer for 30 minutes.Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  When the crust is done freezing, place on a large baking sheet.  Gently line with a piece of foil (large enough to cover the edges) and fill with pie weights.  Bake for 30 minutes, rotating once halfway through.  Carefully remove the foil and weights and then return to the oven to bake for an additional 5 to 7 minutes, until golden brown.  Transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely.  Once cool, remove the crust from the pan and set on a serving plate.  To make the filling - add the heavy cream, mascarpone, vanilla and honey to a large bowl.  Using a hand-mixer, whip on high until it forms soft peaks (this will take a few minutes - alternatively you can also do this in a stand mixer).  Add in the chocolate chips and whip for a few seconds to incorporate.Transfer the filling to the cooled crust and spread evenly.  Top with the strawberries and blueberries (I like to arrange them in a pattern to make it look pretty - with the blueberries in the center and strawberries around the outside!)."},{"vegetarian":true,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":true,"dairyFree":false,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":false,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":7,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":false,"servings":12,"sourceUrl":"http://www.marthastewart.com/319138/savory-autumn-leaf-pies","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/savory-autumn-leaf-pies-20421","aggregateLikes":52,"creditText":"Martha
