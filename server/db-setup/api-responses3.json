Temper the egg mixture with the hot milk a little at a time, whisking thoroughly between additions. Pour the liquid back into the pot and whisk over low heat.                                                                                                                             3                                                                            Continue to whisk as the mixture thickens. Whisk through the lumps until the pastry cream becomes smooth. When it begins to bubble, whisk for two additional minutes, then remove from heat. Whisk in the butter and vanilla extract until they melt and fully incorporate. With a large rubber spatula, stir in the warm, melted chocolate until it is fully blended. Scrape the pastry cream onto the prepared sheet and press another layer of plastic over the surface. Allow it to cool to room temperature. Transfer to the fridge to chill for at least two hours.                                                                                                                            4                                                                            Before using, place the pastry cream in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment and whip for 1 minute, taking care to scrape down the sides. Stop when the pastry cream is smooth and supple. Use immediately, or, if you'd like to lighten it, fold in the chilled whipped cream.

Work the butter under the skin of the turkey and massage it into the breasts and the legs. Massage the butter on the outside of the skin as well. Tie the legs together over the breast so they will protect it during cooking and help keep it moist and juicy.Gravy preparation: Put the onions, carrots, celery, garlic, apples, bay leaves, cinnamon stick and thyme in a roasting pan and season with salt.  Arrange the turkey on top of the veggies and refrigerate overnight UNCOVERED!  Yes, that's right, uncovered.  This will help the skin dry out and become really brown and crispy. Make sure that there is no raw food near the turkey in the refrigerator. After refrigerating overnight, the turkey is ready to go in the oven.Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.Put 2 cups chicken stock and 1 cup apple cider in the bottom of the roasting pan. Roast the turkey in the preheated oven until the skin gets really nice and brown, about 40 minutes. Lower the oven heat to 350 degrees F for the remainder of the cooking time. Baste the turkey every 30 minutes or so and add more stock to the roasting pan, if needed. Cook about 17 minutes per pound. Once it gets to the proper color, tent the turkey with aluminum foil to prevent it from getting too dark.Remove the turkey from the oven when an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the turkey registers 160 degrees F. Make sure that the thermometer is not touching a bone when doing the reading.  When the turkey has reached the proper temperature, remove it from the roasting pan to a cutting board and let it rest for at least 30 minutes. Cover loosely with aluminum foil.Strain all the veggies over a bowl to separate them from the stock/mixture. Discard the veggies. Skim off the fat and add it to the roasting pan. This is the fat for the roux. Put the roasting pan over 2 burners and over a low heat and whisk in the flour. Cook until the mixture looks like wet sand, about 4 to 5 minutes. Slowly whisk in the remaining 1 cup apple cider, remaining chicken stock and the stock/cider mixture. Cook until the mixture has thickened and reached a gravy consistency.  Taste and adjust the seasoning. Pour into a serving pitcher or bowl.Carve the turkey, transfer to a serving platter and serve with the gravy.Cook's Note: Don't fight over the drumsticks.Give thanks for such a great turkey!!!

Add in the egg and vanilla, mixing thoroughly. Beat in the flour, baking soda and salt.When that is done, fold in the two cups of chocolate chips by hand, and prepare to put them on some parchment paper lined cookie sheets.Roll a heaping tablespoon of cookie dough into a ball, 12 per cookie sheet.Take a glass and using the bottom, flatten out each cookie. If the cookie sticks, start wetting the bottom of the glass with water, they will come right off.Flatten each of them as much as you can. This is a dry dough – no sticky chewiness going on here- but it’s just wet enough to make perfect little flat cookie patties.Bake at 375 for 9-11 minutes, until golden brown. Cool on the sheets completely.These turned out to be wonderfully crispy, crunchy and were surprisingly a hit with everyone. The butter flavor really is apparent in these ones due to the lack of flavor that comes with brown sugar, but that isn’t a bad thing at all.

Also, Never Trust a Skinny Cook recommended freezing the cheese balls before baking and/or using fat free string cheese."},{"vegetarian":true,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":false,"dairyFree":true,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":false,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":5,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":false,"servings":12,"preparationMinutes":15,"cookingMinutes":60,"sourceUrl":"http://thelemonbowl.com/2011/05/healthy-banana-bread.html","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/healthy-banana-bread-482966","aggregateLikes":69,"creditText":"The Lemon Bowl","sourceName":"The Lemon Bowl","extendedIngredients":[{"id":18371,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg","name":"baking powder","amount":2,"unit":"tsp","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"2 tsp baking powder","metaInformation":[]},{"id":18372,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg","name":"baking soda","amount":0.5,"unit":"tsp","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"½ tsp baking soda","metaInformation":[]},{"id":9040,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/bananas.jpg","name":"bananas","amount":3,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"3 medium ripe bananas - smashed","metaInformation":["ripe","medium","smashed"]},{"id":1123,"aisle":"Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg","name":"eggs","amount":2,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"2 eggs","metaInformation":[]},{"id":20081,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png","name":"flour","amount":1.25,"unit":"c","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"1¼ c all-purpose flour","metaInformation":["all-purpose"]},{"id":2047,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg","name":"salt","amount":0.5,"unit":"tsp","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"½ tsp salt","metaInformation":[]},{"id":19335,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg","name":"sugar","amount":0.75,"unit":"c","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"¾ c sugar","metaInformation":[]},{"id":2050,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla-extract.jpg","name":"vanilla","amount":1,"unit":"tbs","unitShort":"tbs","unitLong":"tb","originalString":"1 tbs vanilla","metaInformation":[]},{"id":4513,"aisle":"Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vegetable-oil.jpg","name":"vegetable oil","amount":1,"unit":"tbs","unitShort":"tbs","unitLong":"tb","originalString":"1 tbs vegetable oil","metaInformation":[]},{"id":20080,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png","name":"whole wheat flour","amount":0.5,"unit":"c","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"½ c whole wheat flour","metaInformation":["whole wheat"]}],"id":482966,"title":"Healthy Banana Bread","readyInMinutes":75,"image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Healthy-Banana-Bread-482966.jpg","imageType":"jpg","cuisines":[],"instructions":"Pre-heat oven to 325 degrees.Grease and lightly flour a bread pan and set aside.In a large bowl, wisk together eggs and sugar until thick and creamy.Add mashed bananas, buttermilk, vanilla and oil then wisk to combine.In a medium bowl, combine all-purpose flour, wheat flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt.Wisk dry ingredients together to make sure there are no lumps.Add dry mixture to banana mixture and beat until just blended.Pour contents into prepared pan and bake for about 60 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean.

Scoop 1 tablespoon sized balls and place them on a wax paper lined cookie sheet. Chill while you prepare your candy. Melt white chocolate according to package directions. Halfway through melting, add the peanut butter to the bowl. Stir often, until smooth. (I heated mine for about 1 1/2 minutes on HIGH, stirring every 30 seconds and adding the peanut butter after 45 seconds.) Tip: heat an electric griddle to 200°F and line it with a kitchen towel. Place your bowl of melted candy on the griddle so it stays melted during dipping. Dip each truffle in the candy and tap off the excess. I use a spoon to coat the candy, then I place the truffle on a fork and tap off the dripping candy. Use a toothpick to carefully transfer the truffle from the fork back to the cookie sheet. Repeat with all the truffles. If it’s cool in your house and the truffles have hardened by the time you dip them all, re-dip immediately. If they’re still wet, chill until hardened, then do the second dipping. We’re double dipping because the dark truffle shows through the light coating. The second dip is optional.

Add 1/4 cup oil, the lemon zest and juice, oregano and the chicken. Seal the bag tightly and use your hands to vigorously massage the marinade into the chicken, making sure that the chicken is evenly coated. Marinate for at least 10 minutes at room temperature.Meanwhile, remove the rind from the watermelon, cut the fruit into 1-inch cubes and put in a large mixing bowl. (You should have about 6 cups total.) Quarter the cucumber lengthwise and cut into 1-inch pieces. Place on top of the watermelon in the mixing bowl. Cut the feta into 1/2-inch cubes, put on top of the cucumber and top with the Kalamata olives. (Do not mix yet.) Reserve.Remove the chicken from the marinade and place on a platter. Lightly oil the grill grates. Sprinkle the chicken liberally with salt and pepper and arrange the pieces skin-side down on the grill, leaving some space between the pieces. Cook until the skin is lightly charred and releases itself from the grill, about 2 minutes. Then rotate the chicken about 90 degrees so that the skin won't burn and cook another 2 minutes. Flip and cook for an additional 5 minutes. Cover the grill and cook until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the deepest part of each chicken thigh reads 165 degrees F, about 5 more minutes. Transfer to a platter and rest for at least 5 minutes before serving.While the chicken is resting, brush the cut sides of the baguette halves with 2 tablespoons oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Arrange the bread cut-side down on the grill until lightly charred and warmed through, about 2 minutes. Halve the remaining garlic clove and lightly rub the cut sides of the garlic onto the hot bread. Halve each piece of baguette.Scatter most of the mint over the watermelon mixture.  Add the remaining 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil and a large pinch of salt and pepper and gently stir to combine.Divide the watermelon salad among 4 large dinner plates along with a piece of chicken and some bread.

Using a Popsicle stick or wooden chopstick, mark the stick at the level of the cider; remove the stick and mark again at 1/2, 1/4 and 1/8 of the amount between the bottom of the stick and your first mark. These marks will serve to help you gauge when your cider has reduced to between 1/7th and 1/8th of the original amount.Bring cider to a boil over high heat and then reduce to medium-low and simmer, uncovered, until reduced, approximately 2-3 hours. Check the level against your stick measure at regular intervals; overcooking will result in a syrup that is too thick (if that happens it can be remedied with the addition of some water).Cider is finished when it gets just above the 1/8th mark and should coat the back of a spoon. Remove from heat and strain if desired. I use butter muslin, a more tightly woven form of cheesecloth that works much better than the fabric you find at the grocery store but if that is what you have just layer several layers together to most effectively strain the liquid.Pour into a container and refrigerate. Cider syrup can be canned but I never do; it has a long shelf life in the fridge and ours is long gone before it could ever go bad!Combine bourbon and cider syrup over ice and stir gently.

Rinse brussels sprouts and remove any damaged or dirty outer leaves. Place on a cutting board and slice off the hard root end. Using a sharp knife, thinly slice the brussels sprouts. When you're done, use your fingers to gently separate the leaves so that the shredded sprouts resemble a very fine slaw. Place in a large bowl and set aside. 2. To toast the pecans, place a medium frying pan on the stove top. Turn on medium-high heat. When the pan is hot, add a single layer of pecans. Stir frequently with a spatula until they start looking darker and you can smell the toasted nuts. Remove from heat and spread out on a plate to cool to room temperature. Make sure you watch the pecans closely, they can burn pretty quickly and they will keep cooking after removing them from the pan.3. While the pecans are cooling, make the dressing.

Roll the Cocoa Puffs in the chocolate, coating them completely. Lift them out with a fork, letting the excess chocolate drip off, and place on a parchment-lined baking sheet to set. Store in a cool place.                                                            For the Chocolate Soup (makes about 4 1/2 cups):                Put 1 cup of the milk in a small saucepan with the juniper berries. Bring to a boil, then turn off the heat and let the juniper infuse for 25 minutes. Have the chopped chocolate ready in a heatproof bowl, and, remember, the finer you've chopped the chocolate, the better.                                                                Bring the milk back to a boil, then strain into a measuring cup. Add some of the remaining 3 cups milk, if needed, to make 1 cup. Pour the hot milk over the chocolate, let it sit for a moment, then whisk to melt the chocolate and make an emulsion.

For the Devon Foam:                Whisk the heavy cream and Devon cream together in a bowl until thick. Whisk in the milk, then froth with an immersion blender (add additional milk if you need to). Transfer to a pitcher and refrigerate until you're ready to serve.                                                            To Serve:                Thin the chocolate soup with some cold milk if it's too thick to sip, and froth it again with an immersion blender.                                                                Divide the soup among sixteen small glasses (for tasting portions) or among eight coffee cups. Drop in a few of the Cocoa Puffs, then spoon on a layer of the Devon foam. Top with a few more Cocoa Puffs.

Position a rack in the center of the oven and heat the oven to 425F.    In a medium bowl, combine the panko, butter, parsley, and lemon zest. Add a pinch of salt and a grind of pepper and stir to evenly distribute the ingredients.    Line a heavy-duty rimmed baking sheet with parchment. Arrange the cod fillets on the baking sheet and season all over with salt and pepper. Divide the panko topping among the fillets, pressing lightly so it adheres. Roast until the breadcrumbs are browned and the fish is mostly opaque (just cooked through), with a trace of translucence in the center (cut into a piece to check), 10 to 12 minutes, depending on the thickness of the fillets.

When the breadcrumbs are ready, mix them together with the ground beef, ground pork, black pepper, onion, soy sauce, and salt in a large bowl. Knead the meat until it becomes sticky and binds together; divide the mixture into 4 equal parts. Lightly dab your hands with sesame oil. Using your palms, roll each part of the meat into a ball, then pat the ball flat, shifting it from hand to hand, to form a 1/2-inch-thick patty (patting like this compresses the meat and removes air pockets). Press down to make an indentation in the center of the patty (which prevents the patty from puffing up into a ball while it grills). Place the completed patties on a sheet of aluminum foil.                                                                                                                             3                                                                            Preheat a grill to medium. Grill the burgers until they’re nicely browned, about 10 minutes, flipping twice. These burgers have to cook through completely because of the pork; you’ll see no pink in the middle, but they’ll still be incredibly juicy and tasty. Let the burgers rest for 2 minutes. Spoon the wasabi ketchup on top and serve."},{"vegetarian":true,"vegan":true,"glutenFree":true,"dairyFree":true,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":false,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":1,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":false,"servings":4,"preparationMinutes":10,"cookingMinutes":0,"sourceUrl":"http://www.lifesambrosia.com/2009/04/cucumber-salad-with-sweet-thai-chili-vinaigrette-recipe.html","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/cucumber-salad-with-sweet-thai-chili-vinaigrette-567787","aggregateLikes":25,"creditText":"Lifes Ambrosia","sourceName":"Lifes Ambrosia","extendedIngredients":[{"id":11206,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cucumber.jpg","name":"cucumber","amount":1,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"1 cucumber, thinly sliced","metaInformation":["thinly sliced"]},{"id":1002020,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic-powder.jpg","name":"granulated garlic","amount":0.25,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"1/4 teaspoon granulated garlic","metaInformation":[]},{"id":1082047,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg","name":"kosher salt","amount":4,"unit":"servings","unitShort":"servings","unitLong":"servings","originalString":"Kosher salt to taste","metaInformation":["to taste"]},{"id":11282,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-onion.jpg","name":"onion","amount":0.5,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"1/2 onion, thinly sliced","metaInformation":["thinly sliced"]},{"id":1022053,"aisle":"Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vinegar-(white).jpg","name":"rice vinegar","amount":2,"unit":"tablespoons","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoons","originalString":"2 tablespoons rice vinegar","metaInformation":[]},{"id":4058,"aisle":"Ethnic Foods","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sesame-oil.jpg","name":"sesame oil","amount":1,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoon","originalString":"1 teaspoon sesame oil","metaInformation":[]},{"id":19335,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg","name":"sugar","amount":0.25,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"1/4 teaspoon sugar","metaInformation":[]},{"id":98962,"aisle":"Ethnic Foods","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/fish-sauce.jpg","name":"sweet chili sauce","amount":2,"unit":"tablespoons","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoons","originalString":"2 tablespoons sweet Thai chili sauce","metaInformation":[]}],"id":567787,"title":"Cucumber Salad with Sweet Thai Chili Vinaigrette","readyInMinutes":10,"image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Cucumber-Salad-with-Sweet-Thai-Chili-Vinaigrette-567787.jpg","imageType":"jpg","cuisines":["american"],"instructions":"In a small bowl whisk together rice vinegar, sweet Thai chili sauce, sesame oil, sugar, granulated garlic and salt.Place sliced cucumber and onion in another bowl.

Prepare the marinade in a large bowl, stirring together all of the marinade ingredients.  Place steak in the bowl and coat on all sides with the marinade.  Let the steak sit in the marinade and come to room temperature while you prepare the grill.  (No need to marinate the steak more than 20 minutes or so.)2 Prepare the grill for direct high heat.  If you are using charcoal, use approximately 5 pounds of coals.  Bank the coals so that more of them are on one side than the other, so that you have a high heat zone and a lower heat zone.3 When the grill is ready and hot, remove the meat from the marinade and dry it all around with paper towels.  Sprinkle all sides of the tri-tip generously with both salt and freshly ground black pepper.  4 Place the tri-tip on the grill, on the hot direct heat side.  Leave the cover off and watch carefully for flare-ups.  As the meat browns, any fat will melt and drip on to the coals causing flare-ups.  These are okay, as long as they don't get out of control.  Keep moving the tri-tip around the grill away from the flames if they get too high.  After one side of the meat is browned (about 5 minutes) use tongs to flip it on to the other side.  When it is browned all around, move the tri-tip to the lower heat side of the grill.  Cover the grill and close the vents enough so that you maintain about 300-325°F temperature in the grill. (If you are using a charcoal grill, you can place a meat thermometer through the vents to measure the heat.)  If you are using a gas grill, turn off one of the burners and move the meat over that burner for indirect heating. 5 Cook the tri-tip until a meat thermometer reads 130°F when inserted into the thickest part of the meat (15-30 minutes, depending on the thickness of the meat).  Remove the tri-tip from the grill.  Cover with aluminum foil and let rest for 10 minutes.6 Prepare the salsa by combining all of the salsa ingredients into a small bowl.7 Cut the tri-tip in 1/4-inch slices against the grain.  Serve with the salsa."},{"vegetarian":true,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":true,"dairyFree":false,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":false,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":8,"gaps":"GAPS_FULL","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":false,"servings":4,"preparationMinutes":15,"cookingMinutes":0,"sourceUrl":"http://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/sauteed-green-beans","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/sauteed-green-beans-397045","aggregateLikes":58,"creditText":"Taste of Home","sourceName":"Taste of Home","extendedIngredients":[{"id":16069,"aisle":"Canned and Jarred","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/lentils-brown.jpg","name":"beans","amount":9,"unit":"ounces","unitShort":"oz","unitLong":"ounces","originalString":"1 package (9 ounces) frozen cut green beans, thawed","metaInformation":["green","frozen","thawed","cut "]},{"id":1001,"aisle":"Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg","name":"butter","amount":2,"unit":"tablespoons","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoons","originalString":"2 tablespoons butter","metaInformation":[]},{"id":2003,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/basil.jpg","name":"dried basil","amount":0.25,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"1/4 teaspoon each dried basil, oregano and parsley flakes","metaInformation":["dried"]},{"id":11284,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/onion-powder.jpg","name":"dried onion","amount":1,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoon","originalString":"1 teaspoon dried minced onion","metaInformation":["dried","minced"]},{"id":2047,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg","name":"salt","amount":0.25,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"1/4 teaspoon salt","metaInformation":[]}],"id":397045,"title":"Sauteed Green Beans","readyInMinutes":15,"image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Sauteed-Green-Beans-397045.jpg","imageType":"jpg","cuisines":[],"instructions":"Directions                                                                                In a large skillet, saute beans in butter for 4-5 minutes.

Peel and slice the carrots, parsnips, and celery root and toss them in a soup pot with about 3 cups water, 1 teaspoon salt, the honey, and the spices. Simmer the vegetables, covered, until they are completely tender, about 30 minutes. Add the roasted yam and the onion as soon as they are ready, along with the vegetable broth, grated orange rind, and citrus juices.5. Puree the soup in batches in a blender or in the pot with an immersion blender until perfectly smooth. Return it to a clean pot, bring it back to a simmer, and taste it. Correct the seasoning with more salt or a little more lemon juice if needed. Stir in the butter for a richer taste and silky textureor leave it out if you prefer a vegan soup.6. Serve the soup with a drizzle of fresh olive oil on top. For a really spectacular dish, drop a spoonful of dark red salsa in the center of each bowl. (A salsa that is not hot, just mildly spicy, and incredibly flavorful, is a splendid finish.)"},{"vegetarian":true,"vegan":true,"glutenFree":true,"dairyFree":true,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":true,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":0,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":false,"servings":12,"sourceUrl":"http://www.bakersroyale.com/cupcakes/blackberry-cabernet-cupcakes/","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/blackberry-cabernet-cupcakes-50455","aggregateLikes":857,"creditText":"Bakers Royale","sourceName":"Bakers Royale","extendedIngredients":[{"id":9042,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/blackberries.jpg","name":"blackberries","amount":3,"unit":"cups","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"3 cups blackberries","metaInformation":[]},{"id":14097,"aisle":"Alcoholic Beverages","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/red-wine.jpg","name":"cabernet sauvignon","amount":0.5,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"½ cup Cabernet Sauvignon","metaInformation":[]},{"id":19335,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg","name":"sugar","amount":1,"unit":"tablespoon","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoon","originalString":"1 tablespoon sugar","metaInformation":[]}],"id":50455,"title":"Blackberry Cabernet Cupcakes","readyInMinutes":45,"image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/blackberry_cabernet_cupcakes-50455.jpg","imageType":"jpg","cuisines":["american"],"instructions":"Macerated Berry Mixture:1.

Pat dry eggplant and brush both sides generously with olive oil, place on backing sheet.Make dressing. Blend all ingredients in a blender or food processor...adding a little more water  (only if necessary) to get the blender going. Do not blend too smooth... you want to see pieces of the herbs.Grill eggplant slices, covering grill, checking heat to make sure they don't burn, rotating as necessary. Eggplant is done when the white becomes slightly translucent. Stack them on a heat proof dish and cover tightly with foil so they continue cooking through. You could place this on your upper grill rack if you have one, or just set aside, covered.  Grill tomato slices, just a few minutes on each side. If you grill too long, they will fall apart, so just a couple minutes, just to warm them is enough.Grill the Halloumi cheese just until grill marks appear.Arrange all on a platter, layering drizzle with the dressing and a sprinkle of salt and pepper, and garnish with fresh mint leaves. Serve at room temp. If you want to serve this Napoleon Style- a stacked individual portion, layer eggplant, tomato, and haloumi spooning a little mint dressing on each layer, until 4-5 inches tall.
