crust: Place flour, almonds, powdered sugar and salt in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse until combined.Scatter butter over the surface of the dry ingredients. Replace lid and pulse again until the butter is in small pieces with some larger ones. Pulse on low speed while drizzling the egg yolk through the feed hole. Continue pulsing until the dough comes together.For easier handling, wrap dough in plastic wrap and chill until very cold.Butter the bottom and sides of a tart pan. Press the dough evenly onto the bottom and up the sides. Chill until very cold.Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Prick the tart dough with a fork. Blind bake the tart shell by pressing a piece of parchment paper against the dough and filling it with pie weights or dry beans to prevent the dough from shrinking or puffing up. Bake for 15-20 minutes and remove the pie weights and parchment paper. Continue baking until golden brown. A total of 30-35 minutes.Let crust cool completely.For the cardamom pastry cream: In a 2-3 quart saucepan, heat milk with ¼ cup of the sugar and the 4 cardamom pods until it is very hot to the though, but not boiling. Remove from heat and let steep for at least 30 minutes. Reheat the milk until very hot.While cardamom is steeping in the milk, beat the eggs and egg yolks, salt and remaining ¼ cup sugar on medium-high speed with an electric hand mixer until very thick and pale yellow. Sift the cornstarch over the top of the eggs/sugar. Continue beating. Remove cardamom pods from the milk. Drizzle the hot milk into the egg/sugar/cornstarch mixture. Pour everything back into the pan and cook over medium heat until the mixture starts to thicken and bubble. Whisk constantly and cook for another minute. Remove from heat and whisk in the cold butter.Transfer to a clean bowl and cover with press plastic wrap on the surface of the pastry cream. Chill until very cold. Whisk to loosen it before filling the tart.For assembly: Spread the pastry cream evenly in the baked tart shell. Arrange the fruit in a decorative way on top of the pastry cream. Brush the top of the fruit with the melted rose jelly.Chill for about 30 minutes before serving for easier slicing. Keeps for about 2 days in the fridge."},{"vegetarian":false,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":true,"dairyFree":false,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":false,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":7,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":false,"servings":4,"preparationMinutes":5,"cookingMinutes":15,"sourceUrl":"http://www.food.com/recipe/joes-special-ground-beef-spinach-eggs-96477","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/joes-special-ground-beef-spinach-eggs-101407","aggregateLikes":99,"creditText":"Food.com","sourceName":"Food.com","extendedIngredients":[{"id":11457,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/spinach.jpg","name":"baby

If making the ciabatta in a stand mixer: Stir the yeast into the milk in a mixer bowl; let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes. Add the water, oil, and biga (be sure to weigh the biga, don’t just measure it by volume) and mix with the paddle until blended. Mix the flour (be sure to weigh the flour, don’t just measure it by volume) and salt, add to the bowl, and mix for 2 to 3 minutes. Change to the dough hook and knead for 2 minutes at low speed, then 2 minutes at medium speed. The dough will be very sticky. Knead briefly on a well-floured surface, adding as little flour as possible, until the dough is still sticky but beginning to show evidence of being velvety, supple, springy, and moist. (If the dough seems almost impossibly sticky to work with, reread the headnote above from author Carol Field.) If making the ciabatta in a food processor: Stir the yeast into the milk in a large bowl; let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes. Add 1 cup plus 3 tablespoons of cold water, the oil, and the biga (be sure to weigh the biga, don’t just measure it by volume) and mix, squeezing the biga between your fingers to break it up. Place the flour (be sure to weigh the flour, don’t just measure it by volume) and salt in the food processor fitted with the dough blade and pulse several times to sift the ingredients. With the machine running, pour the biga mixture through the feed tube and process until the dough comes together. The dough will be very sticky. Process about 45 seconds longer to knead. Finish kneading on a well-floured surface until the dough is still sticky but beginning to show signs of being velvety, supple, moist, and springy. (If the dough seems almost impossibly sticky to work with, reread the headnote above from author Carol Field.)2. Place the dough in an oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let rise until doubled, about 1 1/4 hours. The dough should be full of air bubbles, very supple, elastic, and sticky.3. Cut the dough into 4 equal pieces on a well-floured surface. Roll each piece into a cylinder, then stretch each cylinder into a rectangle, pulling with your fingers to get each piece long and wide enough. It should be approximately 10 by 4 inches. 4. Generously flour 4 pieces of parchment paper placed on peels or upside-down baking sheets. Place each loaf, seam side up, on a piece of parchment. Dimple the loaves vigorously with your fingertips or knuckles so that they won’t rise too much. The dough will look heavily pockmarked, but it is very resilient, so don’t be concerned. Cover the loaves loosely with damp towels and let rise until puffy but not doubled, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. The loaves will look flat and definitely unpromising, but don’t give up; they will rise more in the oven.5. Approximately 30 minutes before baking, preheat the oven to 425ºF (218ºC) and slide 2 baking stones on the center rack to heat. [Editor’s Note: If like us, you haven’t yet brought yourself to ante up for a baking stone, let alone two of them, flip some large cast-iron skillets upside down and bake the bread on their bottoms. It ought to do the trick. It has for us.)6. Just before baking the ciabatta, sprinkle the stones with cornmeal. Carefully invert each loaf onto a stone. If the dough sticks a bit to the parchment, just gently work it free from the paper. If you need to, you can leave the paper and remove it 10 minutes later.

Add sugar and 3 tablespoons of beaten egg white mixture and mix on medium-low speed until a sticky dough is formed and no large chunks remain. Add almond flour and mix until combined.Whisk 1 tablespoon of water into the remaining tablespoon or so of egg white and set aside.Pour sliced almonds onto a shallow dish or plate. Divide dough into 6 even balls (approximately 50 grams each, if you want to be extra accurate. A large, 3 tablespoon size cookie scoop is just about the perfect size). Drop one ball onto the sliced almonds. Roll, using the almonds to prevent the dough from sticking to your hands, into a 4-inch log. Transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet, and gently shape into a crescent, pressing down to flatten slightly. Repeat with remaining dough.Preheat your oven to 375 degrees F. Let cookies sit, uncovered, for 30 minutes, then brush with egg white mixture. Bake for 15 to 18 minutes or until bottoms are golden brown. Remove from oven and let cool on cookie sheet while you prepare the glaze.In a small saucepan, combine cream, butter, and corn syrup. Stir over medium-low heat until melted and smooth. Remove from heat and add chopped chocolate; the residual heat should be enough to fully melt the chocolate. If not, return to low heat for a minute at a time until mixture is smooth.Remove from heat and quickly dip cooled cookies into glaze. You can either dip one half, as I did, or you can dip both dips. Return to baking sheet and let sit for 30 minutes until glaze is set. If you have extra glaze, it makes a great ice cream topping. Or better yet, use it to dip some fresh strawberries.Cookies will keep, covered in an airtight container, for up to 1 week."},{"vegetarian":true,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":false,"dairyFree":false,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":true,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":170,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":false,"servings":1,"preparationMinutes":5,"cookingMinutes":18,"sourceUrl":"http://www.averiecooks.com/2013/06/chocolate-chunk-cookie-sticks.html","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/chocolate-chunk-cookie-sticks-519940","aggregateLikes":30609,"creditText":"Averie Cooks","sourceName":"Averie Cooks","extendedIngredients":[{"id":18372,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg","name":"baking soda","amount":0.5,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"1/2 teaspoon baking soda","metaInformation":[]},{"id":10419903,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chocolate-chips.jpg","name":"chocolate chunks","amount":0.75,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"about 3/4 cup chocolate chunks or chips (I used Enjoy Life Mega Chunks)","metaInformation":["(I used Enjoy Life Mega Chunks)"]},{"id":20027,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg","name":"cornstarch","amount":1,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoon","originalString":"1 teaspoon cornstarch","metaInformation":[]},{"id":1123,"aisle":"Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg","name":"egg","amount":1,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"1 large egg","metaInformation":["large"]},{"id":20081,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png","name":"flour","amount":1.25,"unit":"cups","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour","metaInformation":["all-purpose"]},{"id":19335,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg","name":"granulated sugar","amount":0.25,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"1/4 cup granulated sugar","metaInformation":[]},{"id":19334,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-sugar-dark.jpg","name":"light brown sugar","amount":0.75,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"3/4 cup light brown sugar, packed","metaInformation":["light","packed"]},{"id":2047,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg","name":"salt","amount":1,"unit":"pinch","unitShort":"pinch","unitLong":"pinch","originalString":"pinch salt, optional and to taste","metaInformation":["to taste"]},{"id":2050,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla-extract.jpg","name":"vanilla extract","amount":2,"unit":"teaspoons","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"2 teaspoons vanilla extract","metaInformation":[]},{"id":4513,"aisle":"Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vegetable-oil.jpg","name":"vegetable oil","amount":0.5,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"1/2 cup canola or vegetable oil (1/2 cup unsalted melted butter may be substituted)","metaInformation":["unsalted","melted"]}],"id":519940,"title":"Chocolate Chunk Cookie Sticks","readyInMinutes":23,"image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Chocolate-Chunk-Cookie-Sticks-519940.jpg","imageType":"jpg","cuisines":[],"instructions":"Preheat oven to 350F.

Look very serious while your sister is adding the eggs.  Serious = adorable.Add the applesauce.Mix it all together.Add in the dry ingredients.  Fold in the nuts by hand.  Put the cupcake batter into lined muffin tins.  We used red liners to make them look even more like apples.  Bake in a preheated 350 degree oven for 18 to 20 minutes.Beat the cream cheese and butter until light and fluffy.  Add the brown sugar and beat until combined.Now that I am thinking about it, a sprinkle of cinnamon in that frosting would have been a really good idea.Using a sharp knife or a cookie cutter, cut some leaf shapes out of the Fruit Roll Up.Frost the cupcake with the Brown Sugar Buttercream.Sprinkle the red sanding sugar generously on the cupcake.

                                                       Combine the stock and halved garlic head in a big saucepan and simmer for about 15 minutes to give the stock a nice, garlicky taste; strain out the garlic. Keep warm.Bring a pot of salted water to boil for the rigatoni.Pour 1/4 cup olive oil in a large saucepan. Add the sage, rosemary and thyme and warm the oil over medium heat to infuse it with the flavor of the herbs, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the sausage and cook, breaking up the sausage with the side of a big spoon until well browned. Chop the carrots, celery, and onion in a food processor. Add to the saucepan and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, until the vegetables are softened but not browned.To the pan with the sausage stir in the crushed tomatoes, bay leaf, cannelloni beans, and chicken stock. Bring to a simmer and cook for 15 minutes stirring occasionally.Cook the rigatoni in the boiling water for 6 minutes; it should be slightly underdone. Drain and stir into the simmering soup. Add the parsley, and salt and coarsely ground black pepper, to taste. Discard the bay leaf and herb sprigs.To serve, preheat the broiler. Put the baguette slices in a single layer on a baking sheet. Sprinkle with the Parmigiano and broil until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown, about 3 minutes. Ladle the soup into bowls and float a couple of the baguette slices on top.

In a small bowl, pour in milk and 2 tbsp of fruity pebbles. Gently push the fruity pebbles until they are completely soaked in the milk. Heat your cereal up for about 20 seconds. Drain out cereal with a strainer.You should be left with 3 tbsp or slightly over 3 tbsp of cereal milk.2. Take 3 tbsp of the cereal milk and addinto a microwave safe mug. This cake is about the size of a cupcake so your mug should hold at least 8 oz of liquid. If your mug is much bigger, that is fine, but your cake won't rise as high in your mug. Add in flour, sugar, baking powder and oil. Using a mini whisk, mix until batter is completely smooth and no flour lumps remain.3. Stir in 1 tsp of fruit pebbles. Sprinkle additional 1 tsp of fruity pebbles over top of cake. Cook cake in microwave for about 1 minute at full power. Let cool a few minutes before eating.*You can use other types of cereal, but if you use less sugary cereals, you may need to add more sugar to the batter, or if you use more sugary cereals, you might want to reduce the amount of sugar added to the batter. Also, different cereals may yield different taste results. I found that fruity pebbles quickly changed the milk to a fruity pebbles flavored milk without having to let it soak too long and had a prominent flavor you can taste in the cake."},{"vegetarian":false,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":true,"dairyFree":false,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":false,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":12,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":false,"servings":2,"sourceUrl":"http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2011/12/smoked-salmon-with-shrimp-horseradish-cream-and-lime-vinaigrette.html","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/smoked-salmon-with-shrimp-horseradish-cream-and-lime-vinaigrette-200614","aggregateLikes":14,"creditText":"Serious Eats","sourceName":"Serious Eats","extendedIngredients":[{"id":1001056,"aisle":"Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sour-cream.jpg","name":"creme fraiche","amount":2,"unit":"tablespoons","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoons","originalString":"2 tablespoons crème fraiche","metaInformation":[]},{"id":11216,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ginger.jpg","name":"fresh ginger","amount":1,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoon","originalString":"1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger","metaInformation":["fresh","grated"]},{"id":19296,"aisle":"Nut butters, Jams, and Honey","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/honey.jpg","name":"honey","amount":2,"unit":"teaspoons","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"2 teaspoons honey","metaInformation":[]},{"id":2055,"aisle":"Condiments","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/horseradish-sauce.jpg","name":"horseradish sauce","amount":2,"unit":"teaspoons","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"2 teaspoons horseradish sauce","metaInformation":[]},{"id":11252,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/iceberg-lettuce.jpg","name":"lettuce","amount":4,"unit":"handfuls","unitShort":"handfuls","unitLong":"handfuls","originalString":"4 handfuls small leaf lettuce","metaInformation":["small"]},{"id":9159,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/lime-wedge.jpg","name":"limes","amount":2,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"2 limes","metaInformation":[]},{"id":4053,"aisle":"Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg","name":"olive oil","amount":4,"unit":"tablespoons","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoons","originalString":"4 tablespoons olive oil","metaInformation":[]},{"id":2047,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg","name":"salt and pepper","amount":2,"unit":"servings","unitShort":"servings","unitLong":"servings","originalString":"salt and pepper","metaInformation":[]},{"id":15152,"aisle":"Seafood","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/shrimp.jpg","name":"shrimp","amount":20,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"20 large shrimp, with shells on","metaInformation":["with shells on","large"]},{"id":15077,"aisle":"Seafood","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/smoked-salmon.jpg","name":"smoked salmon","amount":4,"unit":"ounces","unitShort":"oz","unitLong":"ounces","originalString":"4 ounces thinly sliced smoked salmon","metaInformation":["smoked","thinly sliced"]}],"id":200614,"title":"Smoked Salmon with Shrimp, Horseradish Cream and Lime Vinaigrette","readyInMinutes":30,"image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Smoked-Salmon-with-Shrimp--Horseradish-Cream-and-Lime-Vinaigrette-200614.jpg","imageType":"jpg","cuisines":[],"instructions":"Procedures                                                                              1                                                                            Bring a large pot of water to a boil.

                   Butter a 9-by-3-inch round cake pan. Make the caramel: Cook the sugar and corn syrup in a large skillet over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar is dissolved and the mixture is dark amber, 7 to 10 minutes.Reduce the heat to medium. Carefully add the cream and 4 tablespoons butter (it will splatter) and cook, stirring, until combined, about 3 minutes.Remove the skillet from the heat and let sit 1 minute. Pour 1 1/2 cups caramel into a glass measuring cup and set aside. Pour the remaining caramel into the prepared pan and set aside until set, about 30 minutes.Cut 3 apples into quarters and cut out the cores with a paring knife. Arrange the pieces skin-side down in the pan (overlapping them slightly) to form a ring about 1/2 inch from the edge. Save any pieces that do not fit for later.Halve the remaining whole apple crosswise. Scoop out the seeds with a melon baller or measuring spoon, leaving the stem on the top half. Chop the bottom and any of the leftover quartered apples into pieces; set aside.Arrange the apple top, stem-side down, in the center of the pan. If the quartered apples shift, just push them back into place.Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Make the batter: Whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and cinnamon in a medium bowl. In a small bowl, whisk the sour cream, orange juice and vanilla.Using a stand mixer with the paddle attachment, beat the butter and sugar on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes.Crack the eggs into a small bowl. Slip them into the mixer bowl, one at a time, and beat until the mixture is pale and creamy, about 5 more minutes. Scrape down the bowl and beater with a rubber spatula.With the mixer on low speed, add half of the sour cream mixture, then half of the flour mixture. Repeat. Turn off the mixer and scrape down the bowl with a rubber spatula; finish combining the batter by hand.Spread the batter over the apples in the pan. Top with the chopped apple. Bake on the middle oven rack until the cake is brown on top and springs back when pressed, 1 hour to 1 hour 20 minutes (don't worry if the top is dark). Cool in the pan on a rack.Bring 1 inch of water to a simmer in a skillet wide enough to hold the cake pan. Carefully run a sharp knife around the inside of the pan several times, then rest the pan in the water to soften the caramel, about 8 minutes. Remove the pan from the water and dry.Invert a plate on top of the cake, then flip over the cake and plate. Using pot holders or a towel, wriggle the pan off. Soften the reserved 1 1/2 cups caramel in the microwave, about 2 minutes. Drizzle the cake with some of the caramel. Slice and serve with the rest.Photographs by Kana Okada                                                    Recipe courtesy of Food Network Magazine                         CATEGORIES:

flour, the yeast, and nutmeg or mace; set aside.2  In a medium saucepan heat and stir the 1 cup milk, the 1/2 cup butter, the granulated sugar, and salt just until warm (120 degree F to 130 degree F) and butter almost melts. Add milk mixture to dry mixture along with the two eggs and vanilla extract. Beat with an electric mixer on low to medium speed for 30 seconds, scraping side of bowl constantly. Beat on high speed for 3 minutes. Stir in lemon zest and as much of the remaining flour as you can.3 Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead in enough of the remaining flour to make a moderately soft dough that is smooth and elastic (3 to 5 minutes total). Place dough in a lightly greased bowl, turning once to grease the surface. Cover; let rise in a warm place until double in size (for 1 to 1-1/2 hours).4 If you are making the poppy seed filling from scratch, combine the filling ingredients in a saucepan.  Cook over low heat until it thickens, stirring often. Set filling aside to cool.5  Punch dough down. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Divide dough in half. Cover; let rest 10 minutes. Grease 2 baking sheets. 6 Roll each dough half into a 16x8 inch rectangle, about an 1/8 inch thick.  Cut each rectangle into 8 4x4 squares.  Place a large, heaping tablespoon of poppy seed filling onto the center of each square.  If you want, add a few raisins to the top of the filling.  Brush the four corners of each square with water.  Draw the corners up and gently press together.  Secure with a toothpick. Place on well greased baking sheets, 2 inches apart.  Cover; let rise in a warm place until nearly double (about 35 minutes).  7 Brush with an egg wash made with one egg beaten with a tablespoon of milk. Bake in a 375 degree F oven for 12 to 15 minutes or until golden. Transfer to wire racks; cool completely.

Latkes","readyInMinutes":75,"image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/potato-latkes-344248.jpeg","imageType":"jpeg","cuisines":["jewish"],"instructions":"Directions                                                        Peel the potatoes and shred them in a food processor fitted with the shredding blade; transfer the potatoes to a large bowl as the food processor fills up. Repeat with the onion. Transfer the onion to the bowl with the potatoes and stir in the matzo meal, egg, baking powder and salt.Fill a large skillet with 1/2 inch oil. Heat over medium-high heat until the oil is very hot but not smoking. To test if the oil is hot enough, drop a small piece of potato into the oil; if the potato sizzles steadily, the oil is ready.Working in batches, scoop the potato mixture by 1/4-cupfuls and add them carefully to the skillet, flattening each latke slightly with a spatula. Fry, turning the latkes once, until golden brown and cooked through, about 3 minutes. Drain on paper towels. Remove any loose bits of potato mixture between batches with a slotted spoon.Serve the latkes immediately, or keep them warm in a 200 degree F oven. Garnish with fresh herbs and serve with sour cream and Spiced Apple-Pear Sauce.Cook's Note: If you need to fry a lot of latkes, it's best to make multiple batches rather than one double batch. The longer the mixture sits, the wetter it becomes which makes the latkes fall apart more easily as they cook.                                                Spiced Apple-Pear Sauce:                                        Combine the apples, pears, lemon juice, cinnamon sticks, nutmeg, 1 tablespoon sugar and 1/4 cup water in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Cover, reduce the heat to medium-low and cook until the apples and pears are very soft but still a bit chunky, 15 to 20 minutes. Taste the mixture and add the remaining tablespoon of sugar if desired.Remove the sauce from the heat and stir a few times until the sauce is well combined with small chunks. Cool to room temperature. Remove the cinnamon sticks and serve. (For a smoother sauce, remove from heat, remove the cinnamon sticks and then whisk the mixture until smooth before cooling.)

minutes.  Line a 8×4 inch loaf pan with parchment paper and grease the sides with oil.  Mix together the milk and vinegar and set aside for 5 minutes or until it curdles.In a large bowl add the curdled milk mixture, sugar, pumpkin puree and vanilla extract.  Blend it well preferably using an electric beater.  Stir in the oil (See My Notes) and blend it once again.Hold a sieve over the wet mix and sift in the flour, cinnamon, baking soda and salt.  Stir until just combined.Mix in the chopped cranberries too (See My Notes).  Do not over mix.Pour the batter in the prepared pan and bake it for 50-55 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.  I took out mine from the oven after 53 minutes.Place the pan on a cooling rack for about 15 minutes.  Since we have lined the bottom of the pan with parchment paper you should be able to get the bread from the pan in such a short span of time.

Continue stirring vigorously until the dough is no longer sticky and a film forms on the bottom of the pan.Stir enthusiastically for another minute or so, until the dough is smooth and glossy. This is an important step because if the batter is too loose when you begin incorporating the eggs, the dough will not puff properly come baking time.Transfer to a bowl and allow the dough to cool for 1-2 minutes. Add the eggs, one a time, fully incorporating each one before adding another. Scrape down the bowl each time and check the consistency of the paste. It should be stiff enough to stand, but soft enough to spread. Add the cheese and nutmeg (if using) and stir to combine.Using an ice cream scoop, two spoons, or piping bag fitted with a wide round tip, drop tablespoon-sized dollops of the paste onto prepared baking sheets. Using damp fingers, press down any irregularities in the shape and form a small ball.Bake for 15 minutes; rotate the pans from front-to-back and top-to-bottom, then reduce the heat to 375 and cook for

Combine all of the ingredients in a large pot, cover, and bring to a boil. Heat for 1 minute, stirring to dissolve the salt, then remove from the heat and let cool completely. Cover and refrigerate for at least 8 hours and up to 3 days.2. Pour the brine into a container large enough to hold the pork. Add the pork, cover, and refrigerate for 10 hours (but no longer as the pork may become salty).Make the confit3. Remove the pork from the brine, discarding the liquid. Rinse the pork under cold water and pat it dry with paper towels or let it air dry.4. Preheat the oven to 200°F (93°C). Reach for an ovenproof pot that’s only slightly larger than the porkand has a lid, such as a 12-quart Dutch oven. Place the pork in the pot and add enough lard to cover it by 1/2 to 3/4 inch. Attach a thermometer to the side of the pot.5. Place the pot over low heat until the lard registers 190°F (87°C). Cover the pot, transfer it to the oven, and heat until the pork is meltingly tender. This will probably take 5 1/2 to 6 hours, but start checking after 4 hours. (As the fat in the pork melts, the piece of pork will shrink, so it’s best to transfer the pork and enough lard to cover it to a smaller pot about midway through cooking.) 6. Remove the pot from the oven and let the pork cool to room temperature. The pork can be refrigerated as-is, enveloped by lard in the pot, for up to 1 week. (We prefer to first gently press the confit to compress the internal layers and force out some of the excess fat. This results in a better texture and appearance. To press the confit, transfer it to a baking dish and pour just enough lard into the dish to barely cover it. Cover the belly loosely with plastic wrap, place a smaller baking dish on top of it and weight it with a brick, a large can, a cast-iron skillet, or something of similar weight. Refrigerate for at least 12 hours. Cover and refrigerate the reserved lard. After it’s been pressed, the pork can be covered with some of the reserved lard and refrigerated for up to 1 week.)Serve the confit7. Remove the pot from the refrigerator and let it sit in a warm spot for 2 to 3 hours. You want the lard to soften enough so you can scrape it from the pork, yet you want the pork to remain as cold as possible so it will be relatively easy to slice.8. Remove the pork from the pot and wipe off any lard that clings to the meat. (The lard can be reused to confit additional pork as long as it doesn’t taste too salty. To reserve the lard, pour it into a pot and heat gently to liquefy, then strain through a fine-mesh conical strainer into a storage container. Refrigerate for up to 2 months or freeze for up to 6 months.)9. Using a sharp knife, remove the skin from the pork. Score the fat on the pork belly in a crosshatch pattern. Slice the pork or cut it into squares (actually, the belly can be cut into any shape) and let it rest at room temperature for 20 to 30 minutes.10. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C).11. Heat some canola oil in a large ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat just until smoking. Place the pieces of confited pork, fat-side-down, in the skillet, being careful not to crowd the pan. (You may need to work in batches.) Immediately reduce the heat to medium-low and cook until the excess fat is rendered and the fatty side is browned, about 18 minutes. You will need to pour off any excess fat about halfway through cooking. When the pork is browned, transfer the skillet to the oven until the belly is heated through, about 10 minutes. Remove from the oven, sprinkle with the salt, and serve."},{"vegetarian":true,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":false,"dairyFree":false,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":true,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":46,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":false,"servings":4,"preparationMinutes":30,"cookingMinutes":45,"sourceUrl":"http://www.halfbakedharvest.com/heirloom-tomato-zucchini-galette-honey-thyme/","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/heirloom-tomato-galette-with-honey-+-thyme-793796","aggregateLikes":730,"creditText":"Half

chicken.Pour the soy sauces, rice wine and black vinegar into a wok. Add about four cups of water. Throw in the sugar, star anise, cinnamon, peppercorns, shallots, ginger and garlic. Bring to the boil then allow to boil uncovered for five minutes to allow the alcohol to evaporate.Lower the chicken into the hot liquid, skin side down. When the liquid starts to boil once more, lower the heat, cover the wok and simmer the chicken for 30 minutes, turning the chicken over after 15 minutes. DO NOT overcook.Turn off the heat but leave the chicken in the cooking liquid to finish cooking in the residual heat. Then leave it there until it has cooled to room temperature. One tip: after turning off the heat, turn the chicken over once more so that the skin and the thicker portions of the meat are submerged in the liquid. This will give the chicken a deeper and darker color.When the chicken has cooled, transfer to a chopping board. Chop — through the bones — into serving size pieces. You’ll need a very sharp cleaver to do this. If your knife is less than super sharp, the meat will fall apart while chopping even if the chicken has cooled to room temperature.Serve your soy chicken with ginger-scallion sauce."},{"vegetarian":true,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":true,"dairyFree":false,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":true,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":11,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":false,"servings":4,"preparationMinutes":15,"cookingMinutes":20,"sourceUrl":"http://www.garnishwithlemon.com/mediterranean-quinoa-salad/","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/mediterranean-quinoa-salad-590812","aggregateLikes":697,"creditText":"Garnish with Lemon","sourceName":"Garnish with Lemon","extendedIngredients":[{"id":1019,"aisle":"Cheese","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/feta-cheese.jpg","name":"feta cheese","amount":0.5,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"½ cup crumbled feta cheese","metaInformation":["crumbled"]},{"id":11165,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cilantro.png","name":"fresh cilantro","amount":0.5,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"½ cup chopped fresh cilantro","metaInformation":["fresh","chopped"]},{"id":9152,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/lemon-juice.jpg","name":"juice of lemon","amount":1,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"Juice of 1 lemon","metaInformation":[]},{"id":1009195,"aisle":"Canned and Jarred","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/calamata-or-kalamata-olives.jpg","name":"kalamata olives","amount":0.5,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"½ cup chopped kalamata olives","metaInformation":["chopped"]},{"id":4053,"aisle":"Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg","name":"olive oil","amount":0.25,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"¼ cup olive oil","metaInformation":[]},{"id":1002030,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pepper.jpg","name":"pepper","amount":0.5,"unit":"tsp","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"½ tsp freshly ground pepper","metaInformation":["freshly ground"]},{"id":20035,"aisle":"Pasta and Rice","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/uncooked-quinoa.png","name":"quinoa","amount":1,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cup","originalString":"1 cup uncooked quinoa","metaInformation":["uncooked"]},{"id":11821,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/red-bell-pepper.png","name":"red bell pepper","amount":1,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"1 red pepper, diced","metaInformation":["diced","red"]},{"id":10011282,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/red-onion.jpg","name":"red onion","amount":1,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"1 small red onion, diced","metaInformation":["diced","red","small"]},{"id":10211529,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/roma-tomatoes.jpg","name":"roma tomatoes","amount":2,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"2 Roma tomatoes, seeded and diced","metaInformation":["diced","seeded"]},{"id":2047,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg","name":"salt","amount":1,"unit":"tsp","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoon","originalString":"1 tsp salt","metaInformation":[]},{"id":14412,"aisle":"Beverages","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/water.jpg","name":"water","amount":2,"unit":"cups","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"2 cups water","metaInformation":[]}],"id":590812,"title":"Mediterranean Quinoa Salad","readyInMinutes":35,"image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Mediterranean-Quinoa-Salad-590812.jpg","imageType":"jpg","cuisines":[],"instructions":"Bring quinoa and water to a boil over medium heat.
