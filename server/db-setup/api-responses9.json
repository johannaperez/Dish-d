step.) Bring a small pan of water to a boil and toss in pearl onions, skin and all. Boil covered for three minutes and drain. Plunge into ice water to cool. On a cutting board, cut off root end of onion and squeeze the other end. A perfect pearl onion will pop out. Repeat for all of the onions and discard the skins and roots.In a medium to large pot, place pearl onions, stock, carrots, potatoes, thyme, parsley, salt, pepper, nutmeg, mustard powder, Worcestershire sauce and Tabasco sauce. Bring to a boil and simmer 10-15 minutes until vegetables are tender.Preheat oven to 425 degrees.While vegetables are cooking, in a small pan, melt butter and add flour. Stir and cook over low heat about 4-5 minutes or until the raw flour smell is gone. Set aside.Once the vegetables are tender, remove from heat and add the cream, peas, turkey and optional leftover vegetables. Add butter flour mixture and stir with a wooden spoon until sauce is thick and creamy. Taste and adjust seasoning if needed.Pour mixture into a 3-quart casserole dish or pan.Open up the sheets of pie dough and use one or two that will cover the shape of the casserole dish or pan but don't cover it yet. Using a cookie cutter in the shape of a turkey, fall leaf, acorn or other fall shape, make the cut in the center of the pie. If you are using a wide pan, pinch the two pieces of dough together to fit the shape of the pan and make your cut in the center. Any leftover dough can be baked separately along with the decorative cutouts (see optional step below).Place the dough over the pie and crimp the sides to make a decorative border.Beat the egg with a teaspoon of water and brush onto the dough tops including the cut outs and extra dough. Then sprinkle the sugar all over the tops, sticking to the egg wash.Place the pie in the center of the oven (you may want to place a piece of foil under the dish in case the sauce bubbles over) and bake 25 to 30 minutes until the crust is golden and the pie is bubbling. Remove and let set for ten minutes before serving.Optional step: On a separate sheet pan, place the cut outs and extra crust and bake for 10-12 minutes until golden. These pieces will take less than half the time to cook as the covered pie does. Depending on how creative you are and how much crust you have, you could serve each finished portion of pie with a decorative shape."},{"vegetarian":true,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":false,"dairyFree":false,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":false,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":26,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":false,"servings":3,"preparationMinutes":30,"cookingMinutes":80,"sourceUrl":"http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchens/broccoli-and-red-onion-quiche-recipe.html","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/broccoli-and-red-onion-quiche-747667","aggregateLikes":102,"creditText":"Foodnetwork","sourceName":"Foodnetwork","extendedIngredients":[{"id":11156,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/green-onion.jpg","name":"chives","amount":1,"unit":"tablespoons","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoon","originalString":"1 to 2 tablespoons chopped chives","metaInformation":["chopped"]},{"id":1123,"aisle":"Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg","name":"eggs","amount":3,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"3 large eggs","metaInformation":["large"]},{"id":1053,"aisle":"Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/fluid-cream.jpg","name":"heavy cream","amount":1.25,"unit":"cups","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"1 1/4 cups heavy cream, half-and-half or milk","metaInformation":[]},{"id":1082047,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg","name":"kosher salt","amount":3,"unit":"servings","unitShort":"servings","unitLong":"servings","originalString":"Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper","metaInformation":["freshly ground"]},{"id":9156,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/zest-lemon.jpg","name":"lemon zest","amount":0.5,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"1/2 teaspoon paprika or chile powder, or some grated lemon zest (optional)","metaInformation":["grated"]},{"id":11282,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-onion.jpg","name":"onions","amount":0.25,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"1/4 to 1/2 cup sauteed sliced red onions","metaInformation":["red","sliced"]},{"id":1025,"aisle":"Cheese","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pepper-jack-cheese.jpg","name":"pepper jack cheese","amount":0.75,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"3/4 to 1 cup shredded pepper jack cheese","metaInformation":["shredded"]},{"id":10018338,"aisle":"Frozen","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/dough.jpg","name":"pie dough","amount":3,"unit":"servings","unitShort":"servings","unitLong":"servings","originalString":"Store-bought or homemade pie dough","metaInformation":["homemade","store-bought"]},{"id":12135,"aisle":"Nuts","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/nuts-mixed.jpg","name":"roasted nuts","amount":0.25,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"1/4 to 1/2 cup chopped roasted or steamed broccoli","metaInformation":["steamed","chopped"]}],"id":747667,"title":"Broccoli and Red Onion Quiche","readyInMinutes":110,"image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/broccoli-and-red-onion-quiche-747667.jpeg","imageType":"jpeg","cuisines":["mediterranean","european","french"],"instructions":"Directions                                                        Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.

Taste and adjust seasonings as it sits.Cook the orzo in salted boiling water for 7-9 minutes or until al dente. While you're waiting for it, take a large bowl and rub the inside of it with the cut side of the other half of your garlic clove. Drain your orzo and place it (warm) into the bowl. Add a good glug of olive oil, then the arugula, chickpeas, lemon juice, salt & pepper, and toss. Taste and adjust seasonings.Dice your avocado and season it with a squeeze of lemon and a bit of salt.Place the orzo salad onto a serving plate (or just keep it in the same bowl).

                               Make the pickled onion: Combine the red onion, lime juice, olive oil, oregano and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a small bowl. Let stand 30 minutes or up to 1 day; drain.Meanwhile, make the sauce: Fill a medium pot with water and add the tomatoes, onion and garlic. Bring to a boil and turn off the heat; let cool. Drain the ingredients, then transfer to a blender and puree until smooth; season with salt. Heat the vegetable oil in a medium saucepan; add the tomato mixture and cook until slightly reduced, about 10 minutes. Set aside.Prepare the jalapenos: Heat 1/2 inch vegetable oil in a large saute pan over medium-high heat until very hot. Fry the jalapenos until blistered, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain, then place in a bowl and tightly cover with plastic wrap. Let steam about 15 minutes, then peel off the blistered skins using a paring knife or rub with a kitchen towel. Using a sharp small knife, cut a T in each jalapeno, starting at the top of the pepper and running almost to the bottom. Using a very small spoon or the tip of the knife, carefully remove the seeds and veins. Set the peppers aside.Make the filling: Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a medium skillet. Add the potato and cook, stirring, until golden and crisp, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a plate using a slotted spoon. Add the carrot, onion and garlic to the skillet; cook, stirring, until fragrant, 5 minutes. Add the beef and cook, breaking up the meat, until it starts browning, about 5 minutes. Add the raisins and potato. Cook, stirring, until the meat is cooked through, about 10 more minutes. Season with salt and pepper.Reheat the sauce, adding up to 1/2 cup water if it is too thick. Divide the beef mixture among the jalapenos. Top with the tomato sauce and pickled red onion.Photograph by Dave Lauridsen                                                    Recipe courtesy of Marcela Valladolid for Food Network Magazine

                                               Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.Bring a large pot of water to a boil. When it comes to a boil, salt the water and cook angel hair pasta to al dente, 5 minutes.Heat 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, 3 turns of the pan, in a large nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. Add onions and gently cook 5 minutes. Do not caramelize the onions just let them get translucent and sweet. Add celery, garlic and olives and season with paprika, salt, and pepper. Stir in mustard and hot sauce. Beat together the eggs and 1/4 cup of the cream (eyeball it) and pour into the pan. Stir in the parsley and let the eggs settle and form a foundation, as you would for an omelet. Transfer the pan to the oven and bake until golden, 12 minutes or so. Garnish with the paprika after you remove the frittata from the oven.Heat the remaining extra-virgin olive oil in a deep skillet over medium heat, 2 turns of the pan. Add shallots and cook 5 minutes. Add zest and wine then reduce a minute or so more. Add the remaining 1/2 cup cream, reduce 2 minutes. Add 2 ladles of starchy cooking water from the pasta to the sauce pot just before draining. Toss pasta with cheese and season with salt and pepper. Transfer pasta to a bowl and garnish with a large amount of fresh basil. Yum-o!

sauté pan on medium high heat.  Add the zucchini, onions, garlic, green chiles, and jalapeño to the pan.  Sprinkle with salt and cumin.  Stir to coat the vegetables with the oil in the pan.  Spread the veggies out in the pan and then stir only occasionally, until they are all lightly browned.  Stir in the chopped tomatoes and oregano, lower the heat to low.  Let gently cook for several minutes while you are preparing the tortillas.2 You are going to want to heat up the tortillas first, first to soften them, and then to melt the cheese.  There are two basic ways of doing this.  One way is on the stove top, preferably in a cast iron pan.  Another way is to use the microwave. In both methods you will work in batches. (A third way is to use fresh homemade corn tortillas, which is a great option if you are set up for it.)  2a Preparing tortillas on the stove-top Heat a dollop of olive oil (or other vegetable oil) in a large cast iron frying pan, on medium high. Add a tortilla to the pan, moving it around a bit, and turning it over, so that it spreads around the oil.  Let the tortilla heat until it develops little bubbles of air pockets.  Then place a piece of cheese on one side of the tortilla, and use a metal spatula to fold the other side of the tortilla over the cheese.  Heat until cheese is melted, then remove from pan.  Note that if you have a big enough pan, you can have one tortilla folded over while you have another tortilla doing its initial heating. 2b Preparing tortillas in the microwave Place a paper towel (or half a paper towel) on the heating surface of your microwave.  Spread out 2 tortillas on the paper towels.  Cook on high heat for 20 seconds per tortilla, in the case of 2 tortillas, 40 seconds.  The tortillas should develop air pockets.  (Note that every microwave is a little different, and corn tortillas differ as well. So you may need to adjust the times for your particular setup.) Then place a slice of cheese on one side of each tortilla and fold the tortillas over the cheese.  Cook for an additional 10 seconds per tortilla (20 seconds for 2 tortillas), or until the cheese is melted. 3 Open the tacos and spoon some of the cooked veggie filling into them.  Sprinkle on chopped cilantro and crumbled cotija cheese.  Serve immediately."},{"vegetarian":true,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":false,"dairyFree":false,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":false,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":4,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":false,"servings":48,"preparationMinutes":40,"cookingMinutes":15,"sourceUrl":"http://diethood.com/2012/12/03/ginger-snap-cookies-cream-cheese-frosting/","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/ginger-snap-cookies-with-lemon-cream-cheese-frosting-566458","aggregateLikes":103,"creditText":"Diethood","sourceName":"Diethood","extendedIngredients":[{"id":18372,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg","name":"baking soda","amount":0.5,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"1/2 teaspoon baking soda","metaInformation":[]},{"id":1001,"aisle":"Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg","name":"butter","amount":1.5,"unit":"sticks","unitShort":"sticks","unitLong":"sticks","originalString":"1 1/2 sticks of butter, room temperature","metaInformation":["room temperature"]},{"id":1017,"aisle":"Cheese","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cream-cheese.jpg","name":"cream cheese","amount":4,"unit":"ounces","unitShort":"oz","unitLong":"ounces","originalString":"4 ounces cream cheese (half package), room temperature","metaInformation":["room temperature","(half package)"]},{"id":10019334,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-sugar-dark.jpg","name":"dark brown sugar","amount":0.5,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"1/2 cup dark brown sugar","metaInformation":["dark"]},{"id":1123,"aisle":"Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg","name":"egg","amount":1,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"1 egg","metaInformation":[]},{"id":20081,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png","name":"flour","amount":2,"unit":"cups","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"2 cups all-purpose flour","metaInformation":["all-purpose"]},{"id":2010,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cinnamon.jpg","name":"ground cinnamon","amount":2,"unit":"teaspoons","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"2 teaspoons ground cinnamon","metaInformation":[]},{"id":2011,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cloves.jpg","name":"ground cloves","amount":0.5,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"1/2 teaspoon ground cloves","metaInformation":[]},{"id":2021,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ginger.jpg","name":"ground ginger","amount":2,"unit":"teaspoons","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"2 teaspoons ground ginger","metaInformation":[]},{"id":12311111,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/lemon-oil.png","name":"lemon extract","amount":0.125,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"1/8 teaspoon lemon extract","metaInformation":[]},{"id":19304,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/molasses.png","name":"molasses","amount":0.25,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"1/4 cup molasses","metaInformation":[]},{"id":19336,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/powdered-sugar.jpg","name":"powdered sugar","amount":1.5,"unit":"cups","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"1 1/2 cups powdered sugar","metaInformation":[]},{"id":2047,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg","name":"salt","amount":0.25,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"1/4 teaspoon salt","metaInformation":[]},{"id":2050,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla-extract.jpg","name":"vanilla extract","amount":1,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoon","originalString":"1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract","metaInformation":["pure"]},{"id":19335,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg","name":"white sugar","amount":0.5,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"1/2 cup white sugar","metaInformation":["white"]}],"id":566458,"title":"Ginger Snap Cookies with Lemon Cream Cheese Frosting","readyInMinutes":60,"image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Ginger-Snap-Cookies-with-Lemon-Cream-Cheese-Frosting-566458.jpg","imageType":"jpg","cuisines":[],"instructions":"In a large mixing bowl cream together the butter and both sugars until light and fluffy.Add in the molasses, egg, and vanilla extract;

Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Butter a 9x13-inch baking dish; set aside.2. Arrange the bread in a single layer on a baking sheet. Bake until crisp and brown, about 12 minutes, turning pieces over halfway through and rotating the baking sheet front to back. Let bread cool. Reduce oven temperature to 300 degrees F.3. Meanwhile, heat raisins and ½ cup bourbon in a small saucepan over medium-high heat until bourbon begins to simmer, 2 to 3 minutes. Strain the mixture, placing the bourbon and raisins in separate bowls.4. In a large bowl, whisk the egg yolks, brown sugar, cream, milk, vanilla, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt. Whisk in in the remaining ¼ cup bourbon plus the bourbon used to plump the raisins. Toss in the toasted bread until evenly coated. Let the mixture sit until the bread begins to absorb custard, about 30 minutes, tossing occasionally. If the majority of the bread is still hard when squeezed, soak for another 15 to 20 minutes.5. Pour half the bread mixture into the prepared baking dish, and sprinkle with half the raisins. Repeat with the remaining bread mixture and raisins. Cover the dish with foil, and bake for 45 minutes.6. Meanwhile, mix the granulated sugar and remaining ½ teaspoon cinnamon in a small bowl. Using your fingers, pinch 6 tablespoons butter into the sugar mixture until the crumbs are the size of small peas. Remove the foil from pudding, sprinkle with the butter mixture, and bake, uncovered, until the custard is just set, 20 to 25 minutes. Increase the oven temperature to 450 degrees F and bake until the top of the pudding forms a golden crust, about 2 minutes.7. Let the pudding cool on a wire rack for 30 minutes (or up to 2 hours). Serve alone or with Bourbon Sauce (I strongly recommend the bourbon sauce).8. To Make the Bourbon Sauce: In a small bowl, whisk the cornstarch and 2 tablespoons of bourbon until well combined.9. Using a small saucepan over medium heat, heat the cream and sugar until the sugar dissolves. Whisk in the cornstarch mixture, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, and cook until sauce thickens, 3 to 5 minutes.10. Take the pan off the heat, and stir in salt, butter and the remaining 2 tablespoons bourbon. Drizzle warm sauce over bread pudding."},{"vegetarian":true,"vegan":true,"glutenFree":true,"dairyFree":true,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":false,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":10,"gaps":"GAPS_FULL","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":true,"servings":8,"sourceUrl":"http://lovelylittlekitchen.com/bake-apricot-almond-bars/","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/no-bake-apricot-almond-bars-584779","aggregateLikes":302,"creditText":"Lovely Little Kitchen","sourceName":"Lovely Little Kitchen","extendedIngredients":[{"id":12061,"aisle":"Nuts","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/almonds.jpg","name":"almonds","amount":2,"unit":"cups","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"2 cups raw almonds","metaInformation":["raw"]},{"id":12108,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/coconut-shredded.jpg","name":"coconut flakes","amount":0.75,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"3/4 cup coconut flakes","metaInformation":[]},{"id":4047,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/oil-coconut.jpg","name":"coconut oil","amount":2,"unit":"tablespoons","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoons","originalString":"2 tablespoons coconut oil","metaInformation":[]},{"id":9032,"aisle":"Dried Fruits","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/dried-apricots.jpg","name":"dried apricots","amount":1.5,"unit":"cups","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"1 1/2 cups dried apricots","metaInformation":["dried"]},{"id":2047,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg","name":"salt","amount":0.5,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"1/2 teaspoon salt","metaInformation":[]}],"id":584779,"title":"No Bake Apricot Almond Bars","readyInMinutes":45,"image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/No-Bake-Apricot-Almond-Bars-584779.jpg","imageType":"jpg","cuisines":[],"instructions":"Preheat your oven to 350 degrees.Spread your coconut on a baking sheet and bake for 3-5 minutes.

You can use microwave if you don't like making your own. You can pop it on the stove, or you can use an air popper. We use an air popper about 85% of the time. Set aside in one giant bowl, or a bunch of smaller bowls. Melt the butter on the stove over medium heat. You want to whisk it to keep it smooth. Once it bubbles and melts completely you can turn off the heat. You want the butter warm, but if you pour it over the popcorn too hot it can shrink your popcorn. No one likes shrinkage so use warm, but not scorching butter on popcorn. As it cooks you can mix the Cinnamon Sugar Mix in a small bowl. Combine everything and mix it up really well. I usually toss mine in a mason jar, pop the lid on, and shake the heck out of it. Leftovers can be stored in mason jars and used over muffins and pies. Pour your melted butter over top of the popcorn and make sure you coat it all evenly.Now sprinkle as much, or as little of the cinnamon sugar mix over top of the popcorn. Start slow and taste as you go so you don't go too heavy handed for your own tastebuds. You can always add more, but you can't take away. Good rule of thumb for adding flavour to anything really. Nosh on it immediately while the butter and popcorn are still warm.Serve with a big old \"I'm going to eat too much of this and I really don't care\" smile!"},{"vegetarian":true,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":false,"dairyFree":true,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":false,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":3,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":false,"servings":24,"preparationMinutes":5,"cookingMinutes":8,"sourceUrl":"http://dailydishrecipes.com/banana-bread-nutmeg-cookies/","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/banana-bread-nutmeg-cookies-583354","aggregateLikes":196,"creditText":"Daily Dish Recipes","sourceName":"Daily Dish Recipes","extendedIngredients":[{"id":18371,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg","name":"baking powder","amount":2,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"2 teaspoon baking powder","metaInformation":[]},{"id":18372,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg","name":"baking soda","amount":0.25,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"¼ teaspoon baking soda","metaInformation":[]},{"id":9040,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/bananas.jpg","name":"bananas","amount":3,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"3 bananas (they were pretty average sized)","metaInformation":["(they were pretty average sized)"]},{"id":1123,"aisle":"Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg","name":"eggs","amount":2,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"2 eggs","metaInformation":[]},{"id":20081,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png","name":"flour","amount":2.5,"unit":"cups","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"2½ cups flour","metaInformation":[]},{"id":2025,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ground-nutmeg.jpg","name":"nutmeg","amount":0.5,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"½ teaspoon of nutmeg","metaInformation":[]},{"id":2047,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg","name":"salt","amount":0.25,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"¼ teaspoon salt","metaInformation":[]},{"id":19335,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg","name":"sugar","amount":1,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cup","originalString":"1 cup sugar","metaInformation":[]},{"id":2050,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla-extract.jpg","name":"vanilla","amount":1,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoon","originalString":"1 teaspoon vanilla","metaInformation":[]},{"id":12155,"aisle":"Nuts","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/walnuts.jpg","name":"walnuts","amount":0.5,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"½ cup chopped walnuts","metaInformation":["chopped"]}],"id":583354,"title":"Banana Bread Nutmeg Cookies","readyInMinutes":13,"image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Banana-Bread-Nutmeg-Cookies-583354.jpg","imageType":"jpg","cuisines":[],"instructions":"In your stand mixer or a bowl, combine the butter and the sugar until it gets fluffy.Add in the shortening and mix together well.Add the eggs in one at a time and mix well between additions.In another bowl, sift together the flour, baking soda and powder, nutmeg and the salt.Mash the banana in a bowl.

Preheat the grill to medium heat.Mix the ground beef, heavy cream, Worcestershire and the salt and some pepper in a bowl. Use your hands to thoroughly mix the ingredients. Form 1/4 cup of the meat mixture into patties, making 16 patties total. Make an indentation with your thumb to keep the patties from plumping too much when they cook.Grill the sliders until just cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Remove from the grill and pile on a platter.Toast the halved buns on the grill. Place the sliders between the buns and serve immediately.                                                Macaroni and  Cheese and Sliders Bar:                                        Fry the bacon in a skillet over medium-high heat until slightly crisp, about 8 minutes. Remove from the pan and cut into bite-size pieces.In a separate pan, cook the onions in the butter over a low heat until caramelized, 20 to 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.Use a fork to crumble the gorgonzola.Put the bacon, caramelized onions and crumbled gorgonzola into separate bowls. Serve as delicious toppings for both sliders and macaroni cheese.                                                    2011 Ree Drummond All Rights Reserved                         CATEGORIES:

Spoon a sixth of the vegetables in a line on the top third of the wrapper.Fold over the top of the wrapper and press well down all round.

About 30 minutes before you want to cook, put the tomatoes in a bowl and season them with salt, pepper, and sugar. Set aside.2. Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C). Using a sharp, thin-bladed knife, make small 1/2-inch-deep slits all over the pork loin. Slide a garlic sliver into each slit using the edge of the knife. Season the pork all over with salt and pepper.3. Heat the olive oil in a large, heavy-bottomed ovenproof pot over medium-high heat. Add the pork and brown on all sides, about 4 minutes per side. Remove the pork from the pot and set aside.4. Pour off all but 2 tablespoons of oil from the pot. Add the onion and halved garlic cloves and cook slowly, stirring often, until caramelized, 12 to 15 minutes. Add the wine, bring to a boil over high heat, and cook for 2 minutes. Add the reserved tomatoes, thyme, marjoram, and crushed red pepper. Stir in the clam juice and cook over high heat for 2 to 3 minutes.5. Spread the vegetables evenly over the bottom of the pot and rest the pork loin on top of the vegetables. Transfer it to the oven and roast, basting every 10 to 15 minutes, until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the loin reads between 145°F and 150°F (62°C and 65°C), about 45 minutes, for medium; or 160°F (70°C) for more well done. Transfer the pork to a cutting board, cover with aluminum foil, and set aside.6. Put the pot over medium heat. Add the clams, cover, and cook until the clams pop open, 5 to 6 minutes.7. While the clams are cooking, carve the loin into individual chops and arrange decoratively on a platter. When the clams are done, arrange them over and around the chops.8. To serve, spoon some sauce around the platter and scatter the chopped parsley over the pork and vegetables. Serve family style from the center of the table."},{"vegetarian":false,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":false,"dairyFree":false,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":false,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":31,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":false,"servings":4,"sourceUrl":"http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2012/05/refrom-lamb-cutlets.html","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/reform-lamb-cutlets-breaded-lamb-chops-with-ham-201007","aggregateLikes":12,"creditText":"Serious

           Watch how to make this recipe.                                                        In a medium bowl, stir together the yeast and the water. Set aside to proof.After 10 minutes, stir in the all-purpose flour, cover with plastic, set aside in a warm place and let it double in size.In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, cream together the butter and sugar, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the eggs, with the mixer on low speed, one by one. When the mix is smooth, add the vanilla and salt. Stir to blend. Add the bread flour and mix on low speed until fully incorporated.Change the electric mixer attachment to a dough hook. Continue mixing the dough until it becomes a ball. Then, stir in the yeast mixture until thoroughly incorporated. Put the dough in a bowl, cover with plastic and allow to proof, 1 hour to 1 hour 30 minutes.Lightly flour a cool surface and roll the dough out to about 1 1/2-inch thickness. Cut rounds of dough with a cutter and turn them onto a floured baking sheet to rest, 20 to 30 minutes, before frying.Heat the oil in a large pot to 365 to 370 degrees F. Drop the beignets in the hot fat and cook until golden brown on both sides, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove them from the oil with a slotted spoon. Poke the pastry tip into the side of each beignet to inject some of the raspberry jam into the center of each and roll in the granulated sugar. Serve immediately with Vanilla Dipping Sauce.                                                Vanilla Dipping Sauce:                                        In a medium saucepan, bring the cream and milk to a simmer and add the vanilla beans.In a medium bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and sugar until they become a pale yellow color, 3 to 5 minutes. When the milk/cream simmers, pour it gently over the egg yolks and whisk to blend. Pour the entire mixture back into the pot and cook, stirring with a wooden spoon, until the mixture thickens slightly, 5 to 8 minutes. The sauce should register about 170 degrees F on a thermometer and still be smooth. Strain into a bowl, stir in the vanilla and allow to cool slightly before refrigerating.

Transfer the cupcakes to the wire rack and let cool completely before frosting.To Make Frosting:In a medium bowl, mix together cream cheese, butter, and vanilla. Gradually add powdered sugar and cinnamon, mixing well until it’s all incorporated. Use immediately or refrigerate. The frosting will harden in the fridge, so plan on bring it back to room temperature if you must refrigerate it before frosting the cupcakes."},{"vegetarian":true,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":true,"dairyFree":false,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":true,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":23,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":false,"servings":8,"preparationMinutes":10,"cookingMinutes":30,"sourceUrl":"http://www.browneyedbaker.com/2014/04/22/best-butterscotch-pudding-recipe/","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/best-butterscotch-pudding-508102","aggregateLikes":1774,"creditText":"Brown Eyed Baker","sourceName":"Brown Eyed Baker","extendedIngredients":[{"id":20027,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg","name":"cornstarch","amount":0.25,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"¼ cup cornstarch","metaInformation":[]},{"id":10019334,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-sugar-dark.jpg","name":"dark brown sugar","amount":0.5,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"½ cup dark brown sugar","metaInformation":["dark"]},{"id":1125,"aisle":"Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/hard-boiled-egg.jpg","name":"egg yolks","amount":4,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"4 egg yolks","metaInformation":[]},{"id":19335,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg","name":"granulated sugar","amount":0.5,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"½ cup granulated sugar","metaInformation":[]},{"id":1053,"aisle":"Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/fluid-cream.jpg","name":"heavy cream","amount":1,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cup","originalString":"1 cup heavy cream","metaInformation":[]},{"id":9152,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/lemon-juice.jpg","name":"lemon juice","amount":1,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoon","originalString":"1 teaspoon lemon juice","metaInformation":[]},{"id":19350,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/corn-syrup.jpg","name":"light corn syrup","amount":2,"unit":"tablespoons","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoons","originalString":"2 tablespoons light corn syrup","metaInformation":["light"]},{"id":2047,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg","name":"salt","amount":0.75,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"¾ teaspoon salt","metaInformation":[]},{"id":1145,"aisle":"Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg","name":"unsalted butter","amount":0.75,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"¾ cup unsalted butter, cut into ½-inch pieces","metaInformation":["unsalted","cut into ½-inch pieces"]},{"id":2050,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla-extract.jpg","name":"vanilla extract","amount":2,"unit":"teaspoons","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"2 teaspoons vanilla extract","metaInformation":[]},{"id":14412,"aisle":"Beverages","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/water.jpg","name":"water","amount":0.25,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"¼ cup water","metaInformation":[]},{"id":1077,"aisle":"Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/milk.jpg","name":"whole milk","amount":2.25,"unit":"cups","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"2¼ cups whole milk, divided","metaInformation":["whole","divided"]}],"id":508102,"title":"Best Butterscotch Pudding","readyInMinutes":240,"image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Best-Butterscotch-Pudding-508102.jpg","imageType":"jpg","cuisines":[],"instructions":"1. Bring butter, granulated sugar, brown sugar, water, corn syrup, lemon juice, and salt to a boil in a large saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally to dissolve the sugar and melt the butter. Once the mixture is at a full rolling boil, cook, stirring occasionally, for until the mixture reaches 240 degrees F on a candy thermometer (about 5 minutes). 2. Immediately reduce the heat to medium-low and gently simmer (the mixture should maintain a slow, steady stream of bubbles), stirring frequently, until the mixture reaches 300 degrees F on a candy thermometer, about 12 to 16 minutes longer (it should be the color of dark peanut butter and have a slight burnt smell).3. Remove the pan from heat; carefully pour ¼ cup of the heavy cream into the caramel mixture and swirl to incorporate (the mixture will bubble and steam). Allow the bubbling to subside, then whisk vigorously and scrape the corners of pan until the mixture is completely smooth, at least 30 seconds.4. Return the pan to medium heat and gradually whisk in the remaining ¾ cup heavy cream until smooth. Whisk in 2 cups of the milk until the mixture is smooth, making sure to scrape corners and edges of the pan to remove any remaining bits of caramel.5. Meanwhile, microwave the remaining ¼ cup milk for 45 seconds (it should be simmering). Whisk the egg yolks and cornstarch together in large bowl until smooth. Gradually whisk in the hot milk until smooth; set aside.6. Return the saucepan to medium-high heat and bring the mixture to a full rolling boil, whisking frequently. Once mixture is boiling rapidly and beginning to climb toward the top of the pan, immediately pour it into the bowl with the yolk mixture in a single motion (do not add gradually). Whisk thoroughly for 10 to 15 seconds (mixture will thicken after a few seconds). Press the pudding through a fine-mesh sieve into a clean bowl and whisk in the vanilla extract.7. Spray a piece of plastic wrap with non-stick cooking spray and press on the surface of pudding. Refrigerate until cold and set, at least 3 hours. Whisk the pudding until smooth before serving. Leftovers can be stored in the refrigerator, with plastic wrap pressed against the surface, for up to 4 days."},{"vegetarian":false,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":true,"dairyFree":false,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":false,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":21,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":false,"servings":4,"preparationMinutes":45,"cookingMinutes":45,"sourceUrl":"http://www.vegrecipesofindia.com/restaurant-style-veg-dum-biryani-recipe/","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/vegetable-biryani-how-to-make-vegetable-dum-biryani-487451","aggregateLikes":199,"creditText":"Veg

Feeding the starter (once a day)","readyInMinutes":5,"image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/ii--Feeding-the-starter-(once-a-day)-546775.jpg","imageType":"jpg","cuisines":[],"instructions":"Using a wooden spoon that you'll preferably reserve for this purpose, stir the chef starter in the jar to smooth it out; its consistency will turn from mousse-like to pancake-batter-like.Spoon out all but 1 tablespoon of the starter. Throw the excess out or pour it into an airtight container that you'll keep in the fridge (I use a 2-cup tub of yogurt that I've cleaned and saved)*.Pour the filtered water into the jar of starter and stir it in. Add the flour and stir it in energetically until smooth (this also helps incorporate some air into the starter) -- I usually count to 30. Scrape down the sides of the jar with the spoon, put the lid on the jar, and place the jar on the counter.Rinse the wooden spoon; it's best not to use detergent on it, or some of it might end up in the starter.If the starter is in good shape, it will bubble up and rise in the jar to double in volume after a few hours (how many hours depends on the vitality of the starter and the temperature), before settling and slowly sitting back down in the jar (see pictures below).Using a wooden spoon, scoop the 70 grams of starter from the jar into a clean bowl, about 500 ml or 2 cups in capacity. (This should leave you with about 1 tablespoon chef starter in the jar.) Pour the water into the bowl and stir it in. Add in the flour and stir it in energetically until smooth (this also helps incorporate some air into the starter). Scrape down the sides of the bowl with the spoon, cover the bowl with a small plate or lid, and place the bowl next to the chef starter so they can tell knock-knock jokes to one another all night.Rinse the wooden spoon (again, no detergent) and go to bed.In the morning, you'll feed the chef starter as usual, but you won't need to remove any because the extra starter has just been used.Combine the starter, water, flour, and gluten if using in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook. Mix on lowest speed for a few seconds, just until combined, and let rest for 30 minutes (this step, called autolysis or autolyse, allows the flour to absorb more water and the gluten strands to shorten, making the dough easier to handle later).Add in the salt, and knead at moderate speed for 7 minutes (I use speed 1 or 2 of 10 on my KitchenAid), until the dough is smooth and shiny and pulls away from the sides of the bowl. It will still be tacky, because this is a dough with a rather high hydration. Note that different flours have different absorbencies, so you may have to play with the quantities of flour and water from one loaf to another until you determine how wet you want the dough to be.[You can also knead the dough by hand, but it will take longer and you may want to use a little less water -- say, 360 ml or 1 1/2 cups -- so the dough is less tacky.]Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel and place it in a temperate, draft-free spot.An hour or two later, when the dough has started to rise a little, use a flexible scraper to \"fold\" it over itself in the bowl, as demonstrated in this video (the dough will be less shaggy that this, but the gesture is the same). This folding step helps give structure to the dough and develops the flavor of the bread. Cover the bowl with the towel again.An hour or two later, if you can and if you don't forget, fold the dough again.Six to eight hours after the kneading -- the exact time will depend on the temperature, the vigor of your starter, and the mix of flours you've used --, when the dough has about doubled in volume, it is ready for baking. Another way of knowing is to poke it gently with your finger: if the indentation springs back, the dough needs more time; if it stays hollow, it's ready.[Alternatively, you can prepare the sponge in the morning and put together the dough in the evening. After the first folding, cover and let it ferment in the fridge it all night. In the morning, let it come back to room temperature for about 2 hours, then continue as written below. This will produce a slightly more tangy loaf.]Pull out an ovenproof cast-iron pot with a lid (make sure the handle of the lid can take a high temperature without melting) such as this one, or an ovenproof glass casserole such as this one; ideally, the vessel should be about 3 liters (3 quarts) in capacity (and not too much more, or the loaf will spread and won't rise as much). Pour a drop of neutral-flavored oil into the pot, add a good pinch of flour, mix with the tips of your fingers and rub this mixture along the bottom and sides of the pot. This will prevent the loaf from sticking to the pot. Set aside.Pour the dough out into a big blop on a generously floured surface (I use a generously floured silicone baking mat). It will be a rather shaggy dough. With well floured hands, lift one edge of the dough and fold it over toward the center. Repeat with the opposite side, so you'll be folding the dough in three like a business letter. Give the dough a quarter of a turn and fold it in three again. Handle the dough with determined gestures, but be gentle: you don't want it to deflate it too much and the surface shouldn't tear. The folding should have given it enough structure that you can pick it up; repeat the folding if that's not the case.Lift the dough delicately with both hands, and flip it upside down as you lower it into the prepared pot; the seam should face down. Using a very sharp thin knife or a razor blade with a handle (such as this incisette), score the top of the bread to form a cross, or the shape of your choice. (See this helpful bread-scoring tutorial for tips.)Place the lid on the pot and the pot in the cold (not preheated) oven. Switch the oven on with a temperature setting of 240°C (460°F) and leave the bread in for 1 hour (starting from the moment you insert the pot; my oven takes 15 minutes to reach 240°C), until well risen and golden brown.Remove the pot from the oven, transfer the loaf onto a rack, and check that it sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom (obviously, the bread will be piping hot, so be careful). If it doesn't, return it to bake a little longer. If it does, let cool completely before slicing (I insist: if you slice it prematurely, the crumb will be gummy). The loaf will keep for about a week if well wrapped, or you can freeze half and take it out later in the week."},{"vegetarian":false,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":true,"dairyFree":true,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":false,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":5,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":true,"servings":4,"sourceUrl":"http://www.ibreatheimhungry.com/2016/08/shrimp-pineapple-fried-cauliflower-rice.html","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/shrimp-pineapple-fried-cauliflower-rice-798733","aggregateLikes":65,"creditText":"I
