In the bowl of a stand mixer (preferably a Bosch) using the paddle attachment, cream the butter and honey.Add the eggs and mix until combined.  Add the milk, vinegar, and yeast mixture.  Stir until combined.Stir the flour and measure 3 cups into a bowl. Stirring helps incorporate air into the flour so you don't get a dense bread.  Add the salt and stir it into the 3 cups of flour.  Switch to the dough hook and add the remaining flour, mixing for 5 minutes until a soft dough is formed.  The dough may look sticky, but if touched your finger, should come away clean.Pour 1 Tbsp of oil into a large bowl.  Scrape dough out of the mixing bowl, and into the bowl with the oil. Flip the dough over so all sides of the dough have oil on them.  Cover with plastic wrap and let rise for 1 hour in a warm place.Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface.  Divide the dough into 26 pieces.  Shape rolls, and then squeeze around the roll to create a small head and larger body.  Place onto a greased/lined baking sheet.  Repeat with all but two of the rolls.  Roll the last two rolls into \"breadsticks\" and cut off little 1-inch pieces for the ears.  Make sure to cut 48 ears with the two \"breadsticks\".  It doesn't take much dough for the ears.  Roll the strips for the ears from the center outwards to make them longer like a snake.  Loop the ears and lay them on the bunny head.  Dip a toothpick in flour and press the bottom of the ears to the head of the bunny.  Then dip the toothpick in flour again and poke two holes for the eyes.  Spray some plastic wrap with pan spray and cover the bunnies to let rise until double in size, about 1 hour.Bake at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for 20 to 25 minutes or until the tops are golden brown.  Remove from the oven and brush melted butter over the top.

Separate the halves of the English muffins and spread them with some of the butter. Set them face down on a griddle to lightly brown. Set aside.Add 1 tablespoon of the butter to a skillet over medium heat. Cut the ham into small circles with a biscuit cutter or ring cutter and quickly brown in the skillet.In the same skillet (or a separate one if you run out of room), place 6 egg rings into the pan and brush with butter all over the interior of the rings. Crack an egg into each ring. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and cook. Flip the eggs over when the white is 80 percent set, after 3 or 4 minutes, and cook about 30 seconds to 1 minute more.Lay out the muffins in a row with the bottoms down and the tops ready to go on. Lay a slice of cheese on each. Lay a slice of ham on each. Lay an egg on each. Put the tops on. Immediately wrap them in a foil bag to lock in the heat.                                                    2012 Ree Drummond, All Rights Reserved                         CATEGORIES:

an 8-by-8-inch pan with aluminum foil and optionally spray with cooking spray; set aside. To the canister of a food processor or Vita-Mix (I used a food processor) add oats, dates, sunflower seed butter (I used Trader Joe's), agave, cinnamon, vanilla, and process until mixture comes together. Mixture will be dense and should form a big dough ball in the food processor; this is a good sign. The mixture should err on the side of being wet because 1 cup cereal will be stirred in by hand in the next step, absorbing some of the moisture. When squeezed between fingers, the mixture should hold it’s shape, not fall apart, nor be crumbly at all. If it crumbles or falls apart, it’s too dry and needs more moisture or a binding ingredient such as additional agave, sunflower seed butter, or dates to be added in order for it to come together. Conversely, add more oats if mixture seems very sloppy or wet, noting that 1 cup cereal will be stirred in next, absorbing some moisture. This is not an exact science and you may need to play with the ratios of wet and dry ingredients, but the goal is a mixture that can be packed into a pan, and when sliced, will hold it’s shape in bar form; it should be thick, moist, and dense. Transfer mixture to a large mixing bowl and stir in the crispy rice cereal, slightly crushing it while folding it in with the spoon. Keep folding until all the cereal appears to disappear into the mixture. Firmly press mixture into an even flat layer in prepared pan and smooth it with a spatula; set pan aside. In a medium microwave-safe bowl, melt the chocolate chips on high power, about 1 minute. Stir until chips are melted and smooth, reheating in 10 to 15-second bursts until chocolate can be stirred smooth.

baking the chorizo until the fat comes out and the chorizo becomes crispy. Leave to drain on kitchen paper and put into a processor to blend into smaller bits.Add to the meat bowl. Add your spices (smoked paprika, garlic, ginger, chili, coriander, the parsley and the egg to the bowl as well and mix everything well. If it is too wet (and mine was) you can add some almond flour or regular breadcrumbs if you want.Heat coconut oil in a pan and bake your meatballs brown.In the meantime chop your garlic and onion and heat a larger pan (the balls will go in there as well) and gently cook the onion and garlic until soft. Once that is done, your meatballs will likely be nicely browned so add them to the garlic/onion mix and add the can of tomatoes too. add the ground chili, salt and pepper. Let it simmer for about ten minutes until the meat is cooked. Check for salt and pepper and adjust where needed. "},{"vegetarian":true,"vegan":true,"glutenFree":true,"dairyFree":true,"veryHealthy":true,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":false,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":4,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":false,"servings":4,"preparationMinutes":20,"cookingMinutes":40,"sourceUrl":"http://minimalistbaker.com/baked-falafel-burgers/","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/baked-falafel-burgers-619384","aggregateLikes":35,"creditText":"Minimalist Baker","sourceName":"Minimalist Baker","extendedIngredients":[{"id":16058,"aisle":"Canned and Jarred","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chickpeas.jpg","name":"canned chickpeas","amount":15,"unit":"ounce","unitShort":"oz","unitLong":"ounces","originalString":"1 15-ounce can chickpeas, well rinsed and drained","metaInformation":["rinsed","drained","well","canned"]},{"id":93749,"aisle":"Ethnic Foods","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chili-garlic-sauce.jpg","name":"chile garlic sauce","amount":4,"unit":"servings","unitShort":"servings","unitLong":"servings","originalString":"Garlic Dill sauce","metaInformation":[]},{"id":93749,"aisle":"Ethnic Foods","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chili-garlic-sauce.jpg","name":"chili garlic sauce","amount":4,"unit":"servings","unitShort":"servings","unitLong":"servings","originalString":"Chili Garlic Sauce or Sriracha","metaInformation":[]},{"id":1002014,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ground-cumin.jpg","name":"cumin","amount":1.25,"unit":"tsp","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"1 1/4 tsp cumin","metaInformation":[]},{"id":11215,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg","name":"garlic","amount":3,"unit":"cloves","unitShort":"cloves","unitLong":"cloves","originalString":"3 large cloves garlic","metaInformation":["large"]},{"id":21052,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/mixed-greens-or-mesclun.jpg","name":"greens","amount":4,"unit":"servings","unitShort":"servings","unitLong":"servings","originalString":"Pita or sturdy greens, such as chard or collard greens","metaInformation":[" such as chard or collard greens"]},{"id":16158,"aisle":"Refrigerated","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/hummus.jpg","name":"hummus","amount":5,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"5 minute Hummus","metaInformation":[]},{"id":9150,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/lemon.jpg","name":"lemon","amount":1,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"1 large lemon ( - 2 1/2 Tbsp juice)","metaInformation":["large"]},{"id":20132,"aisle":"Health Foods","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-flour.jpg","name":"oat flour","amount":0.25,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"1/4 - 1/2 cup ground raw walnuts, pecans, almonds or GF oat flour","metaInformation":["raw"]},{"id":11297,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/parsley.jpg","name":"parsley","amount":2,"unit":"cups","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"1 bundle fresh parsley ( - 2 cups chopped)","metaInformation":["fresh","chopped"]},{"id":1012047,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg","name":"sea salt","amount":0.5,"unit":"tsp","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"1/2 tsp sea salt + black pepper","metaInformation":["black"]},{"id":11529,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/tomatoes-canned.jpg","name":"tomato","amount":4,"unit":"servings","unitShort":"servings","unitLong":"servings","originalString":"Tomato, Lettuce, Onion","metaInformation":[]}],"id":619384,"title":"Baked Falafel Burgers","readyInMinutes":60,"image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Baked-Falafel-Burgers-619384.jpg","imageType":"jpg","cuisines":["middl eastern"],"instructions":"Add parsley, garlic, lemon juice, cumin and a healthy pinch each salt and pepper to a food processor and mix to combine.Add chickpeas and pulse until incorporated but still slightly chunky. You want to maintain a bit of texture.Transfer to a mixing bowl and add nut meal (or oat flour) and mix again until a loose dough is formed that's firm enough to be handled. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed. I added a touch more salt.Draw an x in the dough to form 4 sections, then use your hands to form into 4 large patties roughly 1/2-inch thick.Place on a foil-lined baking sheet and refrigerate or freeze for 15 minutes to firm up. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F in the meantime.OPTIONAL STEP: For a little extra crust on the outside, before baking heat a large skillet over medium to medium-high heat and add 2 Tbsp olive or canola oil. Swirl to coat pan, then add falafel. Carefully flip once golden brown  about 3-4 minutes - and then cook on the other side until golden brown as well - 3-4 more minutes. Return to baking sheet to continue baking. Otherwise, just add them straight to the oven for baking.Bake for a total of 30-40 minutes, flipping once at the halfway point for even cooking. The longer you bake them, the firmer theyll get!Serve warm wrapped in a pita or chard bun and desired sauces / toppings. Alternatively, serve atop a salad and use the garlic sauce as a dressing.Burgers will store in the fridge, layered with parchment paper in an airtight container, for several days. Freeze to keep longer."},{"vegetarian":false,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":false,"dairyFree":false,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":true,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":24,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":true,"whole30":false,"servings":4,"preparationMinutes":20,"cookingMinutes":30,"sourceUrl":"http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/giada-de-laurentiis/pizza-rustica.html","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/pizza-rustica-752722","aggregateLikes":893,"creditText":"Foodnetwork","sourceName":"Foodnetwork","extendedIngredients":[{"id":1123,"aisle":"Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg","name":"eggs","amount":4,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"4 eggs, lightly beaten","metaInformation":["lightly beaten"]},{"id":7050,"aisle":"Meat","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/mortadella.jpg","name":"mortadella","amount":0.25,"unit":"pound","unitShort":"lb","unitLong":"pounds","originalString":"1/4 pound mortadella, cut into 1/2-inch pieces","metaInformation":["cut into 1/2-inch pieces"]},{"id":1033,"aisle":"Cheese","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/parmesan-or-romano.jpg","name":"parmesan cheese","amount":1,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cup","originalString":"1 cup Parmesan cheese","metaInformation":[]},{"id":1037,"aisle":"Cheese","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ricotta-cheese.jpg","name":"part-skim ricotta","amount":15,"unit":"ounce","unitShort":"oz","unitLong":"ounces","originalString":"1 15-ounce container part-skim ricotta","metaInformation":[]},{"id":10010123,"aisle":"Meat","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/proscuitto.jpg","name":"prosciutto","amount":0.25,"unit":"pound","unitShort":"lb","unitLong":"pounds","originalString":"1/4 pound prosciutto cotto, cut into 1/2-inch pieces","metaInformation":["cut into 1/2-inch pieces"]},{"id":18337,"aisle":"Refrigerated","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/puff-pastry.jpg","name":"puff pastry","amount":17.3,"unit":"ouncesheets","unitShort":"ouncesheets","unitLong":"ouncesheets","originalString":"1 17.3-ounce package frozen puff pastry (2 sheets), thawed","metaInformation":["frozen","thawed","(2 sheets)"]},{"id":7071,"aisle":"Meat","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salami.jpg","name":"salami","amount":0.25,"unit":"pound","unitShort":"lb","unitLong":"pounds","originalString":"1/4 pound salami, cut into 1/2-inch pieces","metaInformation":["cut into 1/2-inch pieces"]},{"id":1001026,"aisle":"Cheese","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/shredded-cheese-white.jpg","name":"shredded mozzarella","amount":1,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cup","originalString":"1 cup shredded mozzarella","metaInformation":["shredded"]}],"id":752722,"title":"Pizza Rustica","readyInMinutes":50,"image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/pizza-rustica-752722.jpeg","imageType":"jpeg","cuisines":["mediterranean","european","italian"],"instructions":"Directions                                                        Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.In a medium bowl, combine the mortadella, prosciutto, salami, ricotta, mozzarella, Parmesan and three of the eggs. Mix with a rubber spatula until combined. Lay out one sheet of puff pastry and roll it with a rolling pin just to flatten slightly. With the pastry set at an angle so that one corner is facing you, spread half of the mortadella mixture onto the half of the puff pastry that is closest to you. Brush the edges with some of the remaining beaten egg. Fold the pastry corner farthest from you over the filling to form a calzone-shaped triangle. Seal the edges either by crimping with your fingers or by using the tines of a fork. Set the pizza on a parchment-lined baking sheet and brush the outside with the remaining egg wash. Cut a slit in the top for ventilation. Repeat with remaining sheet of puff pastry and the remaining filling. Bake for 30 minutes, or until puffed, golden and cooked all the way through.Let rest for 10 minutes before cutting.

Mound the flour on a work surface and make a well in the center. Add the yeast, milk, lard, and salt to the well. Gradually stir in enough flour with your hands to form a paste, then work in the remaining flour to form a dough and knead until very smooth. (The dough will still be quite sticky at first, but refrain from adding more flour. It may take up to 30 kneads or so before the dough smooths.) On a floured work surface, roll the dough out to a 1-inch thickness, then cut into rounds with a 3-inch cookie cutter. Cut the holes from the middle with a smaller cutter (or, in a pinch, the cap of a soy sauce or other smallish bottle).2. Place the cut pieces of dough on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and let rise for about 30 minutes.3. Heat 2 inches oil in a deep, heavy skillet, preferably cast-iron, over medium-high heat until it measures about 350°F. Slip a few pieces of dough into the hot oil and fry until golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes, then flip carefully and fry until the other side is golden brown, another minute or so. Remove from the oil with a slotted spoon or skimmer and transfer to paper towels to drain. Repeat with the remaining dough.4. Mix together the sugar and cinnamon in a shallow bowl or in a brown paper bag and dredge or shake the cuddureddi in the sugar mixture.

Preheat a broiler or grill. Place the peppers on the grill and cook them until they are BLACK on the outside. Yeah that's right BURN THEM!  When the peppers are black on all sides remove them from the heat and place them in an enclosed environment, either a paper bag or a bowl covered with plastic wrap. Let them sit until they are cool. This can be done a day ahead.Using your fingers scrape all the black off the outside of the peppers.  Remove the stem and the seeds as well. This is a messy job, accept it and move on. If needed, you can use a damp paper towel. Rinsing the peppers washes away all of the sweet pepper juices.Once the peppers are clean, cut the peppers into strips that are about 1 inch wide.  Place about a teaspoon of goat cheese at one end of each pepper strip. Sprinkle cheese with a pinch of the crushed red pepper, pimenton and salt.  Roll up each pepper strip around the cheese and garnish with chopped chives.

                                                     Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F.Heat a large braiser pan over medium-high heat and add the oil. Sprinkle the lamb shanks all over with 2 teaspoons salt. When the pan and oil are hot, sear the shanks on all sides until deep brown, rotating often, about 8 minutes. Remove the lamb to a plate.To the pan, add the carrots, celery, onions and garlic and cook, stirring often with a wooden spoon, until the vegetables are soft and beginning to brown, about 5 minutes. Add the oregano, rosemary and tomato paste and cook, stirring constantly, for 3 minutes to caramelize the paste. Deglaze the pan with the wine and simmer for 3 minutes. Stir in the chicken stock, then add the lamb shanks back to the pan. Bring to a simmer, reduce the heat to medium-low, and cover the pan.Transfer the pan to the oven and cook until the lamb is fork tender, about 2 hours, turning the shanks halfway through.Meanwhile, in a large bowl, whisk together the honey, Dijon and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Add the escarole and radicchio and toss well to coat. Arrange the bitter greens on a large serving platter.When the lamb is tender, remove the shanks to the platter with the greens. Simmer the sauce until reduced slightly, an additional 10 to 15 minutes. Spoon some of the sauce over the lamb. Serve the remaining sauce on the side, for guests to help themselves. Finish the platter by grating some fresh horseradish over the lamb.

Shape dough into a smooth ball, transfer to a large greased bowl. Flip dough once to coat completely with oil. Cover and allow to rise in a warm location for one hour or until doubled in size.

Pour the beer into a turkey sitter (a ceramic stand that holds liquid). Or open the beer can, pour out a few tablespoons and place in a beer-can turkey stand.Combine the mustard powder, garlic powder, dried onion, paprika, granulated garlic, cumin, and salt and pepper to taste in a small bowl.Remove the neck, giblets and any excess fat from the turkey; discard. Rinse the turkey under cold water and pat dry with paper towels. Rub the cavity with 2 to 3 teaspoons of the spice mixture. Brush the outside of the turkey with the canola oil and place drumstick-end down on the sitter or stand. Rub the remaining spice mixture all over the turkey.Place the turkey (on the sitter or stand) on the cooler side of the grill. Cover and cook until the juices run clear and a thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh registers 185 degrees F and 170 degrees F in the breast, 2 to 3 hours. Carefully remove the turkey from the grill, remove from the sitter or stand, and discard the beer. Transfer the turkey to a cutting board and let rest at least 20 minutes before carving.Photograph by Kana Okada                                                    Recipe courtesy of Cat Cora for Food

prepare the bechamel. Melt butter and olive oil together in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Add the flour and cook for 1 minute, whisking constantly, until a smooth paste forms. Continue to cook until the flour loses its starchy aroma. Increase the heat to medium-high, and gradually add in the milk, whisking constantly for about 1 minute, until the mixture is completely smooth. Stir in the grated cheese, chorizo, and paprika, and stir to combine. Season with salt and pepper if needed.Transfer the mixture to a baking dish or bowl that has been greased with cooking spray or oil. Place a layer of plastic wrap directly on the filling mixture, and cover completely, sealing in the edges. Refrigerate until cool and firm, about 1-2 hours.When ready to cook the croquettes, heat oven to 450 degrees F. Remove the filling mixture from the refrigerator. Using your hands or a cookie scoop, form the filling into small balls. Mine were about 1.5-inches in diameter, but you could also make them smaller (about 1-inch diameter).Next, prepare your dipping assembly line. Fill one small bowl with flour. Fill a second with 2 eggs, whisked. And fill a final bowl with panko. Take one filling ball and dip it in the flour until completely coated, then the egg mixture, and finally the panko mixture until it is completely coated. Place ball on a parchment-covered baking sheet. Repeat with remaining filling balls. Then briefly mist the balls with cooking spray or misted olive oil.Transfer sheet to the refrigerator for a final 10 minutes to cool before baking. You want the cheese to be nice and firm so that it doesn't melt too quickly in the oven.When ready, place the baking sheet in the oven and bake for 12-16 minutes, or until the breading is golden and the filling is melted and bubbly. Remove and serve immediately."},{"vegetarian":false,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":false,"dairyFree":false,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":true,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":14,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":false,"servings":8,"preparationMinutes":30,"cookingMinutes":60,"sourceUrl":"http://www.simplebites.net/the-best-pumpkin-spice-pie-with-maple-syrup/","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/the-best-maple-pumpkin-spice-pie-and-a-virtual-baby-shower-502087","aggregateLikes":2029,"creditText":"Simple Bites","sourceName":"Simple Bites","extendedIngredients":[{"id":1123,"aisle":"Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg","name":"eggs","amount":4,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"4 medium eggs","metaInformation":["medium"]},{"id":1053,"aisle":"Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/fluid-cream.jpg","name":"heavy cream","amount":1,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cup","originalString":"1 cup heavy (whipping) cream","metaInformation":["(whipping)"]},{"id":19911,"aisle":"Cereal","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/maple-syrup-or-agave-nectar.jpg","name":"maple syrup","amount":0.6666666666666666,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"2/3 cup pure maple syrup","metaInformation":["pure"]},{"id":18334,"aisle":"Refrigerated","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pie-crust.jpg","name":"pie crust","amount":1,"unit":"9-inch","unitShort":"9-inch","unitLong":"9-inch","originalString":"1 prepared (but not pre-baked) 9-inch pie crust","metaInformation":["prepared","(but not pre-baked)"]},{"id":11424,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pumpkin-puree.jpg","name":"pumpkin puree","amount":1.25,"unit":"cups","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"1 1/4 cups pumpkin puree, homemade if possible","metaInformation":["homemade"]},{"id":1012047,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg","name":"sea salt","amount":1,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoon","originalString":"1 teaspoon sea salt","metaInformation":[]},{"id":1032027,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/no.jpg","name":"spice blend","amount":1,"unit":"Tablespoon","unitShort":"Tablespoon","unitLong":"Tablespoon","originalString":"1 Tablespoon pumpkin spice blend","metaInformation":[]},{"id":1054,"aisle":"Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/whipped-cream.jpg","name":"sweetened whipped cream","amount":8,"unit":"servings","unitShort":"servings","unitLong":"servings","originalString":"Sweetened whipped cream, for garnish","metaInformation":["sweetened","for garnish"]},{"id":93622,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla.jpg","name":"vanilla bean","amount":1,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"Seeds of 1 vanilla bean, scraped, or 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract","metaInformation":["pure"]}],"id":502087,"title":"The Best Maple Pumpkin Spice Pie (and a virtual baby shower!)","readyInMinutes":90,"image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/The-Best-Maple-Pumpkin-Spice-Pie-(and-a-virtual-baby-shower)-502087.jpg","imageType":"jpg","cuisines":[],"instructions":"Preheat the oven to 350F. Keep the pie crust chilled in the refrigerator while you mix up the pie filling.In a large bowl, whisk the eggs and cream together until blended. Add the pumpkin puree and the maple syrup and again whisk well.Finally, add the vanilla, salt and spice blend to the pie filling and combine.Remove pie shell from the fridge and place on the middle rack of the oven. Slide the rack out carefully a couple of inches and pour the filling into the pie shell. Slowly, slide the oven rack back in place, taking care not to spill the contents of the pie shell onto the bottom of the oven.If you find yourself with a little extra filling, simply pour it into a couple of ramekins and bake them alongside your pie until they are set. Chill, top with whipped cream and enjoy them as pumpkin custard.Check pie after about 30 minutes and rotate, if necessary, to ensure even browning of the pie crust.When the center of the pie has puffed up, and jiggles only slightly when the pan is moved, the pie is ready. This will take about one hour.Remove pie from oven and cool on a wire rack. When the pie is room temperature, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to serve.Pie will keep, covered in the fridge, for up to three days, or well-wrapped and frozen for up to 8 weeks."},{"vegetarian":true,"vegan":true,"glutenFree":true,"dairyFree":true,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":true,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":5,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":false,"servings":10,"preparationMinutes":50,"cookingMinutes":45,"sourceUrl":"http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/2835667/jerk-sweet-potato-and-black-bean-curry","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/jerk-sweet-potato-black-bean-curry-212854","aggregateLikes":769,"creditText":"BBC Good Food","sourceName":"BBC Good Food","extendedIngredients":[{"id":16069,"aisle":"Canned and Jarred","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/lentils-brown.jpg","name":"beans","amount":2,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"2 x 400g cans black beans, rinsed and drained","metaInformation":["black","rinsed","drained","canned"]},{"id":10011693,"aisle":"Canned and Jarred","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/tomatoes-canned.jpg","name":"canned tomatoes","amount":400,"unit":"g","unitShort":"g","unitLong":"grams","originalString":"400g can chopped tomatoes","metaInformation":["chopped","canned"]},{"id":2012,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ground-coriander.jpg","name":"coriander","amount":1,"unit":"bunch","unitShort":"bunch","unitLong":"bunch","originalString":"small bunch coriander, leaves and stalks separated","metaInformation":["separated","small"]},{"id":10019908,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/unprocessed-brown-sugar.png","name":"demerara sugar","amount":3,"unit":"tbsp","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoons","originalString":"3 tbsp demerara sugar","metaInformation":[]},{"id":11216,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ginger.jpg","name":"ginger","amount":50,"unit":"g","unitShort":"g","unitLong":"grams","originalString":"50g ginger, roughly chopped","metaInformation":["roughly chopped"]},{"id":1012009,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garam-masala.jpg","name":"jerk seasoning","amount":3,"unit":"tbsp","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoons","originalString":"3 tbsp jerk seasoning","metaInformation":[]},{"id":11282,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-onion.jpg","name":"onions","amount":2,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"2 onions, 1 diced, 1 roughly chopped","metaInformation":["diced","roughly chopped"]},{"id":1022068,"aisle":"Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/red-wine-vinegar.jpg","name":"red wine vinegar","amount":4,"unit":"tbsp","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoons","originalString":"4 tbsp red wine vinegar","metaInformation":["red"]},{"id":11916,"aisle":"Canned and Jarred","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/red-bell-pepper.png","name":"roasted red peppers","amount":450,"unit":"g","unitShort":"g","unitLong":"grams","originalString":"450g jar roasted red peppers, cut into thick slices","metaInformation":["red","thick","cut into  slices"]},{"id":4584,"aisle":"Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vegetable-oil.jpg","name":"sunflower oil","amount":2,"unit":"tbsp","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoons","originalString":"2 tbsp sunflower oil","metaInformation":[]},{"id":11507,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sweet-potato.jpg","name":"sweet potatoes","amount":1,"unit":"kg","unitShort":"kg","unitLong":"kg","originalString":"1kg sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into chunks","metaInformation":["peeled","cut into chunks"]},{"id":2049,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/thyme.jpg","name":"thyme sprigs","amount":2,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"2 thyme sprigs","metaInformation":[]},{"id":98845,"aisle":"Canned and Jarred","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/bouillon-cube.jpg","name":"vegetable stock cubes","amount":2,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"2 vegetable stock cubes, crumbled","metaInformation":["crumbled"]}],"id":212854,"title":"Jerk sweet potato & black bean curry","readyInMinutes":95,"image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Jerk-sweet-potato---black-bean-curry-212854.jpg","imageType":"jpg","cuisines":["asian","indian"],"instructions":"Gently soften the diced onion in thesunflower oil in a big pan or casserole.Meanwhile, whizz together the roughlychopped onion, ginger, coriander stalksand jerk seasoning with a hand-heldblender.

                                            Combine the red wine, garlic, black peppercorns and 2 quarts of water in a large pot and bring to a boil over high heat.Dip the octopus in the boiling liquid for 10 seconds and lift it back out. Repeat the process 3 times. Finally, submerge the octopus in the liquid and reduce the heat to a simmer. Cover with a lid and allow the octopus to poach in the liquid until tender, about 90 minutes.Heat a large saute pan over medium-high heat. Add the bacon and cook until crisp. Transfer the bacon to a paper towel-lined plate and reserve the fat in the pan.Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Preheat a grill to high heat. Warm up half of the Tangerine Sauce in a saute pan on medium heat.Remove the octopus from the poaching liquid and allow to cool before handling, about 10 minutes. Remove the head and discard. Cut off the tentacles from the body and reserve the body for another use. Dip the tentacles into the reserved bacon fat, and place on the hot grill to char very briefly. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer the tentacles to a large ovenproof saute pan, toss with the heated Tangerine Sauce and place in the oven for 5 minutes.To serve, drizzle some of the remaining Tangerine Sauce on each plate. Sprinkle some of the crushed peppercorns and oregano leaves around each plate. Place a tentacle on each plate and sprinkle with some of the bacon. Garnish with the Bulls Blood microgreens and micro arugula. Finish with a drizzle of oil and some freshly ground black pepper.                                                Tangerine Sauce:                                        Reduce the juice and honey in a saute pan over medium heat until syrupy. Allow to cool slightly. Combine in a food processor with the red wine vinegar, mustard, anchovies and chile and process until smooth. While processing, drizzle in enough canola oil to create an emulsified sauce. Season with salt and pepper.

Pour the batter into the prepared baking sheet, and spread out until you have an even layer.Bake in the preheated oven for 13-15 minutes, or until the cake bounces back when gently pressed.Remove from oven and, using a sifter, immediately sift the additional confectioners’ sugar over the cake, until the entire cake is covered. This will help to prevent the cake from sticking when you roll it up.Place a lint-free, thin kitchen towel over the cake, making sure that the cake is covered, and one edge lines up with the 10-inch side of the cake. Place a cooling rack on top of the cloth, and carefully flip the baking pan upside down, turning the cake onto the cooling rack.Carefully remove the parchment paper from the bottom of the cake and, starting on the 10-inch side, roll the cake into a log. Be sure to roll the cloth along with the cake, that will ensure that you can unroll it later to put the filling in. Allow the cake to cool for about 1 hour.Beat together the softened cream cheese and butter until smooth. Add the confectioners’ sugar and vanilla. Beat until smooth again.Unroll the pumpkin cake, and spread the cream cheese filling over the cake, leaving 1-inch clear at the 10-inch side that will be the outside of the roll.Roll up the cake again, this time without the cloth. I like to roll the cake up in the lint-free towel again, just to help hold it’s shape. Wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 4 hours before serving. The Pumpkin Roll Cake can be made one or two days in advance.Remove from the refrigerator 30 minutes before serving to allow the filling to soften slightly.

but not boiling.  Add 1/4 cup of butter to hot milk, and allow mixture to cool to room temperature.  In a large bowl or the bowl of your stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, dissolve yeast in the warm water with 1 tablespoon of the white sugar. Let stand until foamy, about 10 minutes.When yeast mixture is bubbling, add the cooled milk mixture. Whisk in the eggs. Stir in the remaining white sugar, salt and nutmeg. Add the flour one cup at a time. When the dough has pulled together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 to 10 minutes, or mix with dough hook for 10 minutes.Lightly oil a large bowl, place the dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a damp cloth or plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 2 hours. When risen, punch down and divide dough in half, using a kitchen scale if available.Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Grease 2 cookie sheets or line with parchment paper.In a medium bowl, combine room temperature cream cheese and sugar.With a hand mixer, beat until smooth and creamy.Add cherry bourbon (or other flavoring substitute) and beat to combine.In a small bowl, combine brown sugar and cinnamon.Melt butter, and pour over brown sugar/cinnamon mixture.Chop pecans into small pieces, and set aside.Roll dough halves out into large rectangles (approximately 10x16 inches). For cream cheese filling, carefully spread cream cheese mixture over the dough.  Be sure to leave a border without filling for easy closure.For cinnamon filling, spread brown sugar/cinnamon mixture over dough.  Sprinkle with pecans and white sugar.Beginning with the long edge (the 16 inch edge) roll the dough into a jellyroll or log shape.  Pinch closed, all the way across.  Turn dough so seam is on the bottom.  Shape dough into a ring, and connect the ends, pinch to seal.Slice 1/2 inch-deep cuts 2-inches apart across the top of the dough.Cover with a towel and allow to rise in a warm spot for 45 minutes.Brush dough with egg wash, and bake for 25-30 minutes.Allow to cool for 30 minutes on a wire rack before icing.Stir together confectioners sugar, milk/cream and vanilla until smooth.Pour over top of cake, and dust with sanding sugars as desired.Bury the baby, and enjoy!"},{"vegetarian":true,"vegan":true,"glutenFree":true,"dairyFree":true,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":false,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":1,"gaps":"GAPS_5","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":true,"servings":6,"preparationMinutes":5,"cookingMinutes":20,"sourceUrl":"http://cleananddelicious.com/2010/08/07/video_20_minute_tomato_sauce/","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/20-minute-tomato-sauce-521467","aggregateLikes":43,"creditText":"Clean and Delicious","sourceName":"Clean and Delicious","extendedIngredients":[{"id":2004,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/bay-leaves.jpg","name":"bay leaf","amount":1,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"1 bay leave","metaInformation":[]},{"id":10011693,"aisle":"Canned and Jarred","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/tomatoes-canned.jpg","name":"canned tomatoes","amount":56,"unit":"oz","unitShort":"oz","unitLong":"ounces","originalString":"2- 28 oz. cans of crushed tomatoes","metaInformation":["crushed","canned"]},{"id":2027,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/oregano.jpg","name":"dried oregano","amount":1,"unit":"tbsp","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoon","originalString":"1 tbsp dried oregano","metaInformation":["dried"]},{"id":1034053,"aisle":"Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg","name":"extra virgin olive oil","amount":1,"unit":"tbsp","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoon","originalString":"1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil","metaInformation":[]},{"id":11215,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg","name":"garlic","amount":2,"unit":"cloves","unitShort":"cloves","unitLong":"cloves","originalString":"2-3 cloves of garlic, chopped up","metaInformation":["chopped"]},{"id":1032009,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/red-pepper-flakes.jpg","name":"red pepper flakes","amount":1,"unit":"pinch","unitShort":"pinch","unitLong":"pinch","originalString":"A fat pinch of red pepper flakes","metaInformation":["red"]},{"id":2047,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg","name":"salt and pepper","amount":6,"unit":"servings","unitShort":"servings","unitLong":"servings","originalString":"Salt and pepper to taste","metaInformation":["to taste"]},{"id":10511282,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-onion.jpg","name":"yellow onion","amount":1,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"1 medium yellow onion, diced","metaInformation":["diced","yellow","medium"]}],"id":521467,"title":"20 Minute Tomato Sauce","readyInMinutes":25,"image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/20-Minute-Tomato-Sauce-521467.jpg","imageType":"jpg","cuisines":[],"instructions":"Heat oil over medium heat in a medium saucepan.Add onion, red pepper flakes along with a pinch of salt and sauté about five minutes before adding in the garlic.Once the veggies are fragrant, tender, and translucent you are ready to stir in the tomatoes, bay leave, and oregano.Season with some salt and pepper and allow the sauce to come to a boil.Once boiling, reduce to a simmer and cook for another ten minutes.Adjust your seasonings and enjoy!Makes about 6 cups"}]}
