Place them in a jar along with the garlic.Heat the oil to warm (no more than 160 degrees F) and pour into the jar.Let cool to room temperature. Cover and set in a dark place (cabinet or pantry). Remove garlic after 2 days. Use within 3 weeks.Make sure all the fresh herbs have been rinsed and dried (I use a salad spinner to spin-dry).Cut the stems from the parsley and cilantro below the leaves (to have mostly only leaves left).Place the parsley, cilantro, oregano, thyme, rosemary, vinegar, red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper in the bowl of a food processor fitted with a knife blade.Pulse a few times to chop the herbs. Scrape down the sides of the bowl. Pulse while drizzling in the olive oil. Do not over-process or it will become a paste.Transfer the chimichurri sauce to a small bowl. Stir in additional olive oil for desired consistency. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper to taste.Serve immediately or cover and refrigerate overnight. Recommended to make a day ahead for flavors to develop.Cut the bottom stems from the parsely and cilantro. Finely chop the parsley, cilantro, and oregano.Place all the herbs and the garlic infused olive oil in a bowl. Stir to combine. Add the shrimp and toss to coat. Marinate for 20 minutes.Heat a grill to medium-high heat.Strip all but the top 2 to 4 inches of needles from the rosemary branches. Whittle or cut the end to make a point.Skewer the shrimp on the rosemary branches. Season with salt and pepper.Grill the shrimp until they are just cooked through, about 2 minutes per side.Serve the shrimp skewers with chimichurri sauce."

      "instructions": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and grease a 6 cavity donut pan with nonstick spray.In the bowl of an electric mixer, beat together the oil, eggs, sugar, and pumpkin until smooth. In a separate bowl, whisk together the cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, salt, baking powder, and flour.  With the mixer on low, slowly add the flour mixture until just incorporated.  Using a 1/4 cup measure or a large ice cream scoop, portion batter into the donut wells and bake for 12-14 minutes.Remove the donuts from the oven, let cool in the pan for 5 minutes, and then gently coat with cinnamon sugar.  The donuts will still be warm and fragile, but this allows the cinnamon sugar to stick well.  Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.  Wipe the donut pan and fill with batter again and repeat process.  For the eyes, I melted the chocolate chips in a ziploc bag and cut off the corner to pipe small circles.  For \"blood\", squeeze 2 dots of red gel onto each donut.  Close the teeth together in your fingers and squeeze them into the center of each donut.  I found the pressure from the hinge started to break apart some of the donuts, so I ended up clipping the teeth in half so they weren't actually separated.  This way there was no tension on the donuts.Serve warm or store in an airtight container until ready to share!"

Lightly dust both sides of each slice with a few pinches of smoked paprika, rubbing the piquant spice into the surface of the cheese.Preheat your grill and brush the grate with oil. Once the grill is hot, set each slice of cheese onto the grate. Allow each slice to grill for about one minute, or just until the edges begin to get melty. Gently flip the cheese over with the tongs, grilling the other side of the slices. Cook for one more minute, then remove the slices from the grill and set on a plate.Top each slice with a small spoonful of tapenade and garnish with chopped parsley. Serve immediately, while hot.Method for Olive Tapenade: Add all ingredients to a small food processor and pulse until the tapenade is finely chopped. Pop open the lid of the processor and taste. Does it need more acid? Add another teaspoon of lemon juice. Does it need more heat? Layer in a few more turns of the pepper grinder. Does it need a bit more fresh “green” notes? Add another tablespoon of parsley leaves. Pulse again and store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week."

Spray your muffin tins entirely with cooking spray (dont skimp on the spray or your bites will stick). Scoop out enough mixture to fill your standard muffin tins 3/4 full. Press down firmly with your fingers or the back of a spoon. Sprinkle more parmesan cheese on top of each muffin tin portion. Bake in over for 20-30 minutes. Ready when slightly browned on top and a fairly browned crust on bottom and sides has formed. (The charm of these bites is the nice and crispy, almost chewy, crust around all the edges. The cheese melts and bakes into the sides.and oh my, its heavenly. So dont remove too early..but you dont want them burnt and dried out either. So watch them carefully!)Pop out of muffin tins and allow to cool slightly. Dip bites into your favorite dressing and enjoy!"

Reduce heat to medium and cook for about 5 minutes, whisking often to prevent grits from sticking or lumps forming. Add the butter and the American cheese and stir until melted. Reduce heat to simmer, cover and cook for about 20 minutes. Remove from heat, and cover to keep warm.Season the pork with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper. Heat a grill pan to high and spray with cooking spray. Cook the pork for about 4-5 minutes on both sides. Baste with hoisin sauce and cook for an additional 2-3 minutes on each side or until pork is cooked through. Transfer to a platter and clean the grill pan so you can reuse for the shrimp.Place the shrimp in a bowl and add the olive oil, 1 tablespoon of the rice vinegar, 1 teaspoon of the sugar, fish sauce, and red chili flakes and toss to combine. Marinate for 10 minutes. Spray the grill pan with cooking spray and bring it to high heat. Cook the shrimp for 2 minutes on each side or until the shrimp just turn opaque. Remove from the grill and place with the cooked pork.Add the carrots and cucumber matchsticks to a medium size bowl. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon rice vinegar, 1 teaspoon sugar, and the juice of  lime and toss to coat. Set aside.In a small bowl, mix the mayonnaise, chili garlic sauce and juice of the remaining half of lime together.To assemble, hold a waffle cone in one hand. Spoon a few scoops of grits into the base of the cone. Set a slice of liverwurst on the back of the cone and slather with a bit of the chili mayonnaise. Layer a slice of pork on top of the liverwurst. Add a few matchsticks of the cucumbers and carrots, add some mint and cilantro and then spoon more polenta into the cone. Top with 2-3 shrimp. Garnish with more herbs if desired and serve."

In a medium sized pan add butter, chopped chocolate and espresso powder. Melt over medium heat until smooth and creamy. Remove from heat and stir in white sugar and vanilla extract. Check the temperature of the batter. If it's still very warm let it cool for just a bit. If it's cool add in eggs and stir quickly to combine. Add in flour and stir till all combined. Add batter to donut pan (you should have made enough to just fill the 6 donut spaces) and bake for 12 - 15 minutes until fully cooked. Let cool for 15 minutes in the pan, gently take out of the pan and cool on wire rack. Once fully cooled top with fluffy peanut butter frosting. For Peanut Butter Frosting:In a bowl of an electric mixer add butter and peanut butter. Mix till blended. Add in powdered sugar, mix, and add in as much half and half is needed to reach desired constancy. Add in a pinch of kosher salt and give the frosting a good stir."

If you're in a hurry, you can place the mixture in a bowl and set that in an ice bath.  Otherwise, let it chill to room temperature, then stick it in the fridge.Once the mixture is chilled, place the chicken in the brine for 10 to 12 hours.  Don't go beyond 12 hours or the chicken will get too salty.  Discard the brine and pat very dry with paper towels.  Let the chicken sit at room temperature for 1 hour while you prep the other stages.Mix the flour with the garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, cayenne, salt, and pepper.  Split this between two bowls.  Place the buttermilk in a third bowl, set in between the two spiced flour bowls.Preheat your deep fryer to 320 degrees F, and right before frying, dip the legs and thighs into the flour mixture, the buttermilk, then the flour mixture again.  Fry for 10 minutes until golden brown (be careful not to crowd the fryer with too much chicken), and drain on paper towels.Raise the heat to 340 degrees F and dip the wings and breasts into the flour, then buttermilk, then flour.  Fry for 6 to 7 minutes until golden brown and cooked to 160.  Enjoy the best fried chicken of your life!"

      "instructions": "Start with the cake. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F, and line a cake pan with a round of parchment paper on the bottom.Sift together the cocoa powder, flour, malted milk powder, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Set it aside.Whisk the egg, vegetable oil, sugar, buttermilk, vanilla, and hot espresso like heck for a good 30 seconds until foamy and bubbly on top. Add this mixture to the dry ingredients, whisking JUST until the flour disappears (no overstirring allowed. You'll make the cake tough).Pour the batter into the cake pan and bake for about 25-30 minutes until the interior reaches 200 degrees F, but hey, since we're crumbling it up anyway, just use a knife to peek into the middle and see if it's done. And a quick note: the cake/brownie will puff up a ton and then sink in the middle. This is normal.Remove the cake from the pan and let it cool on a wire rack. Time to work on the buttercream.The buttercream is made in the same way as my French Almond Buttercream. In a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat the egg yolks on high speed for 10 minutes until they are very pale. In the meantime, combine the sugar and water in a heavy bottomed saucepan over medium heat, and let the sugar syrup simmer to the soft ball stage (238 degrees on an instant read thermometer).When both the egg yolks and the sugar syrup are ready, pour the sugar syrup into the mixing bowl (the mixer should still be on high speed), aiming as best as you can to pour between the wire whisk and the side of the bowl. Dump in the malted milk powder. Now if you touch the bottom of the bowl, it will be very hot. Beat the egg yolk sugar mixture until the bowl feels neither hot nor cold (about 5 minutes).Turn the mixer down to medium and add the butter, a couple cubes at a time to the bowl, over the course of 10 minutes. Wait until each installment of butter is absorbed until you add the next batch.Melt the chocolate in the microwave or in a double boiler (if you don't know how to do this, see my chocolate article). Add the melted chocolate to the buttercream and mix until the chocolate is distributed. Refrigerate the buttercream until it's cold.To assemble the cake truffles: Crumble up the cooled cake with your fingertips. Add about 1/3 of the buttercream and mix until distributed. If the cake is not sticky enough, you can add a tbsp or two more to the cake, but don't make the cake truffles too wet. Portion out little scoops of the truffle mixture with a cookie scoop and roll into a ball between the palms of your hands. Roll in the chocolate shavings, and refrigerate until they firm up. They will taste best the next day when the flavors have melded together, just make sure to store in an airtight container so they don't dry out. Enjoy!"

      "instructions": "Combine milk and butter in a microwave-safe bowl. Heat on high for 1 minute, then remove and stir. Continue heating in 20 second intervals, pausing after each to stir, until the butter is melted and the milk is warm to the touch but not hot. If needed, let the milk mixture sit for a few minutes until it is warm but not hot.In a separate bowl, whisk together 3 cups flour (not all of the flour), sugar and salt until combined.In the bowl of a stand mixer (*see note below for an alternative method of making this by hand*) fitted with the dough hook attachment, add yeast and lukewarm milk mixture and stir by hand to combine. Add the flour mixture and egg, and beat on medium-low speed until combined. If the dough is sticking to the sides of the bowl, add the remaining flour, 1/4 cup at a time, until the dough begins to form a ball and pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Continue beating for 5 minutes on medium-low speed. Remove the dough hook and cover the dough with a damp towel and let rest for 10 minutes.Meanwhile, make your filling by whisking together sugars and cinnamon in a bowl until combined.When the dough is ready, turn it out onto a floured work surface. Then use a floured rolling pin to roll the dough out into a large rectangle, about 14 x 9 inches in size. (If you want all edges to be even, you can use a pizza slicer to cut the dough into a perfect rectangle.) Use a knife or pastry spatula to spread the softened 1/2 cup of butter out evenly over the entire surface of the dough. Then sprinkle evenly with the cinnamon and sugar mixture.Beginning at the 14-inch edge, tightly roll up the dough. And then give the final seam a little pinch so that it seals. Use a piece of dental floss* to \"cut\" off the two ends of the roll (an inch on each end - discard that dough) so that they are even. Then cut the remaining dough into 11 or 12 equal pieces. (11 rolls seem to fit in a pie plate, while 12 rolls fit in a rectangular pan.) (*To cut dough with dental floss, simply break off a piece of floss about 12 inches long. Then very carefully slide the middle of the floss under the dough to the place where you want to \"cut\". Then pull the ends of the floss up and cross over the top of the dough. Then give a quick tug to literally cut all the way through the dough. This is the best method for not squishing your dough while cutting it -- although the standard knife method still works too.)Place each of the cut cinnamon rolls into a greased pie plate or 9 x 13-inch baking dish. Then cover again with a damp towel, and leave the dish in a warm place to rise for 25 minutes. While the dough is rising, make the icing (instructions below).When the rolls have risen, uncover the dish. Then place on the center rack of the oven and bake at 350 degrees F for 15-20 minutes, or until the rolls are golden and cooked through. Remove and let cool on a wire rack for at least 5 minutes. Drizzle with your desired icing and serve.Either in the bowl of an electric stand mixer, or a mixing bowl, whisk softened butter and cream cheese together until combined. Then whisk in powdered sugar until combined. If the icing is too thick, add a tablespoon or two of milk to thin. Whisk together butter, vanilla and powdered sugar until combined. If the icing is too thick, add a tablespoon or two of milk to thin. If the icing is too thin, add a tablespoon or two of powdered sugar to thicken."

In a food processor, combine avocado, sour cream, lime juice and a pinch of salt. Process until smooth, then set aside.To make the burgers, saut Power Blend for 2 minutes until softened. Add minced garlic and stir for 1 more minute, then remove from heat.In a medium mixing bowl, mash the black beans with a potato masher or food mill. Add sauted Power Blend, egg, bread crumbs, sriracha, salt and pepper. Stir to combine, then form mixture into 6 patties.Cook patties in a non-stick skillet over medium-high heat, about 5-6 minutes per side, until nicely browned.Place 1 burger patty on top of 1 green leaf lettuce. Top with a couple spoonfuls of the caramelized onion and a dollop of avocado crema. Wrap burger leaf around the patty, close with a toothpick, and serve."

You might need less or more water depending on the quality and freshness of the flour. Dough should be soft like plain paratha dough.Let it rest for 15 minutes covered.After 15 minutes, knead the dough once again and smooth out. Divide it into 9 equal portions.Make smooth ball and flatten it between your palms. Simultaneously, heat the tawa or skillet on medium to fry the paratha.While it is heating, work with one flatten ball a time, roll into about 5 inch diameter circle.Then oil and fold as per shown in the method above.Then roll again keeping the square shape, if you manage.Now tawa should be hot, fry the paratha using little oil till it is browned and cooked from both sides.Repeat the same process till all the parathas are ready. If not serving right away then keep them into insulated container."

Fish out the bay leaves, then purée the soup in batches in a food processor or blender. Return to the pan and stir in the milk. Reheat gently and season to taste. Add more stock or water if the soup seems too thick (this will depend on the size of your potatoes). Sprinkle with parsley to serve.Make the toasts: heat oven to 200C/fan 180C/gas 6. Cut the baguette into thin diagonal slices. Mix the oil and mustard together, then brush over both sides of the bread. Spread them on a large baking sheet and bake for 10 mins. Serve with the soup for dipping. They can be baked earlier in the day and served cold or warmed through in the oven."

Shape heaping teaspoons of the mixture into 1-inch balls. In a Dutch oven, heat a tablespoon of oil over medium-high heat. Working in batches, wiping pan in between, saute the meatballs, turning frequently for even browning, until cooked through, about 4 to 5 minutes. Place on a paper towel-lined plate.                                                To make the sauce:                                        Heat oil in the same Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the onions and saute until golden brown, about 8 minutes. Add the crushed red pepper and cook 1 minute. Stir in the remaining ingredients and reduce heat to low.Add the browned meatballs to the Dutch oven and toss gently to coat with sauce.

      "instructions": "To prepare the torte: Preheat your oven to 350°F. Butter and flour a 9-inch springform pan, dusting off the excess. Process the roasted almonds, almond extract and 1 tablespoon of the sugar in a food processor until the nuts are completely pulverized. Transfer to a bowl and toss with the flour.Melt the chocolate on top of a double boiler over hot water, stirring constantly. Remove the melted chocolate from the heat and set aside.Using a hand mixer, cream the butter at medium speed until pale yellow, about 3 minutes. Add the remaining sugar and vanilla extract and continue creaming until the mixture is very light. Add the egg yolks one at a time, making sure each one is completely incorporated into the mixture before adding the next one. Add the melted chocolate and stir well to combine. Stir in the almond mixture and again, combine well.In another bowl beat the egg whites with the hand mixer until stiff, then fold them into the batter with a rubber spatula until combined.Bake for about 40 minutes (25 min if using convection) or until a cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool the torte on a wire rack, removing the springform rim after a few minutes. Let cool completely before adding the frosting.To prepare the frosting: Melt the remaining 8 ounces chocolate in a double boiler and set aside to cool to lukewarm. Beat the heavy cream in a bowl with a hand mixer until it's stiff, adding the scant teaspoon of superfine sugar after a minute of mixing. Start the mixer at lower speed, increasing as you go. The cream will get quite stiff after just 3-4 minutes and you want to stop just as the texture resembles that of soft butter. You can stop sooner than this but I found that the frosting held up better this way. Fold the lukewarm chocolate into the whipped cream and spread on top of the torte. You can serve immediately but I found that this torte tasted even better chilled the next day."

Smooth out batter, creating a circle in an even layer. Cook for 3 minutes or until golden on the bottom and bubbling on top. Flip and cook for an additional 1 minute or until golden. Serve and enjoy immediately with fresh whipped cream and extra sprinkles."

Half way during the cooking process, you may need to add enough water to keep it covered.Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line a roasting pan with aluminum foil. Place the fully cooked corned beef fat side up in the pan. Place in the oven and roast for 45 minutes to an hour or until the fat is nice and crisp. Keep the pot covered and the liquid hot, but not boiling.Meanwhile, when the corned beef has 30 minutes remaining, bring the pot to a boil and add the potatoes. Reduce heat to a simmer and continue cooking until almost tender. Add the cabbage, cover, and cook for about 8 minutes. Remove from the pot and serve with slices of corned beef."

      "instructions": "1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan; set aside.2. In a large bowl, whisk together both flours, the sugar, baking powder and salt. Add the beer and honey and stir with a rubber spatula until thoroughly combined.3. Spread the batter evenly in the prepared loaf pan and drizzle the melted butter evenly over the top of the batter. Bake until the loaf is golden brown and a thin knife inserted into the center comes out clean, about 50 to 60 minutes. Allow to cool to room temperature before slicing. Leftovers should be wrapped tightly in plastic wrap and stored at room temperature for up to 3 days.Notes:While it is best to use bread flour if you have it, you may substitute all-purpose flour in its place.I would recommend using your favorite ale or lager-style beer for this recipe. Use one you enjoy drinking, as some of the flavor does come through in the bread.For a higher loaf, use an 8x4-inch loaf pan and increase the baking time accordingly."

Season the short ribs lightly with salt and pepper and brown them in the fat, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Remove to a plate and set aside.Reduce the heat to medium and add the garlic, carrot, celery, onion, red pepper flakes and anchovies to the pan. Cook for 5 minutes, stirring frequently, or until the onion begins to soften and the vegetables are tender crisp. Stir in the bay leaves, thyme, bourbon, tomato paste, and water and return ribs to pot.Lock the lid of the pressure cooker in place and increase the heat until the cooker reaches full pressure (15 psi). Reduce the heat to medium, and cook for 50 minutes. Remove from the heat and allow the pressure to decrease naturally.Carefully unlock and remove the lid of the pressure cooker; divide the short ribs between 3 warmed plates. Stir the pomegranate molasses into the sauce in the pot and season to taste with additional salt and pepper, if desired. Spoon the pomegranate sauce over the short ribs and serve.Nutrition (per serving): 489 calories, 24.2g total fat, 109mg cholesterol, 327.9mg sodium, 1544.6mg potassium, 24.5g carbohydrates, 1.8g fiber, 3.5g sugar, 34.5g protein"

Add mushrooms and shallots and sauté about 5 minutes (if using chanterelles, dry sauté first for a minute or two and let the mushrooms cook in their own juices before adding the butter).  Add the rice and stir to combine. 3 Add brandy, bring to a boil, and reduce liquid by half, about 3-4 minutes. Add simmering stock, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring enough to keep the rice from sticking to the edges of the pan. Stir the rice almost constantly — stirring sloughs off the starch from the rice, making the creamy sauce you're looking for in a risotto. Wait until the stock is almost completely absorbed before adding the next 1/2 cup.  This process will take about 25 minutes.  The rice should be just cooked and slightly chewy.4  Stir in the Parmesan cheese and season to taste with salt and pepper. Garnish with chopped fresh parsley or chives."

Cook the pieces in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat until the skin is crisped and some of the fat has been released, about 5 minutes. Transfer the kielbasa to a paper towel-lined plate to cool.Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.On a lightly floured surface, roll one piece of puff pastry out to form an 8- by 11-inch rectangle. Using a 3 1/2-inch round cookie cutter, cut out 6 circles from the pastry; cut the circles out as close together as possible and reserve the scraps. Repeat with the second sheet of puff pastry.Wrap a circle of puff pastry around each of a kielbasa, pinching the seams together to seal all the way around so no kielbasa is exposed and gently pulling on the ends to make a tapered football shape. Place on an ungreased baking sheet, seam-side down, and repeat with the remaining pastry and sausage.Brush the rolled sausages with the beaten egg. Use bits of the pastry scraps to make laces on each \"football\" by placing 1 strip lengthwise on top of each and laying 3 smaller strip crosswise over it. Press down gently to adhere and brush the laces with a bit more egg.Bake until the pastry is browned and crisped, 25 to 30 minutes. Serve the pigskins with mustard for dipping.

Halve the tomatoes lengthwise and arrange them in an even layer in a roasting pan or on a rimmed baking sheet. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons olive oil and sprinkle with a little kosher salt and pepper. Wrap the garlic cloves in tinfoil. Place the foil packet of garlic on the baking sheet with the tomatoes and roast for 30 minutes, turning the tomatoes once halfway through the cooking time.</p><p>When cool enough to handle, slice the tip off each clove and squeeze the roasted garlic out. (It will be an awesomely delicious paste). Briefly set aside.</p><p>Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a medium Dutch oven or saucepan. When hot, add the onions and saut for 3 minutes until translucent.</p><p>Add the roasted tomatoes and any juices from the pan to the pot with the onions, and stir in the roasted garlic, the reserved tomato liquid, vegetable stock, sugar, crushed red chili flakes, basil sprigs and chopped basil. Bring the soup to a boil, lower to a simmer and cook uncovered for 20 minutes to allow the awesome flavors to combine. </p><p>Remove the whole basil sprigs from the pot and puree the soup using an immersion blender, food processor, or regular blender. </p><p>Return the pureed soup to the pot and stir in the chopped basil. Taste your fabulous creating and season with salt and pepper to taste. If you want a creamy soup, stir in 1/3 cup of heavy cream over low heat.</p><p>Ladle soup into bowls and garnish with extra ribbons of basil, a drizzle of fancy oil and sprinkling of cheese if youre into that. Maybe get some grilled cheese sticks involved</p>"

Continue cooking for another 3 to 4 minutes, or until onion is soft and translucent. Add sherry or wine to the pan, and deglaze, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan.Stir in tomatoes, paprika, bay leaf and salt and pepper to taste. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and simmer uncovered, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes or until peas are almost cooked through and sauce has slightly thickened.Stir in peas.Using a large spoon, create four hollows in the pea mixture, and carefully break an egg into each hollow. Cover skillet  and simmer until the eggs are cooked as desired (7 minutes should be enough for a soft, runny yolk; 10 minutes for a hard, crumbly yolk).To serve, arrange thick slices of fresh crusty bread or toasted English muffin halves on four plates. Spoon some of the braised peas onto the bread on each plate, then top each serving off with an egg.  Sprinkle with a little fresh parsley, if you have some."

Let it sizzle until golden on both sides, about 5 minutes total. Transfer to a plate and let cool. Set the rest of the loaf aside.2. In a food processor, pulse all of the bell and chile and hot peppers along with the garlic, nuts, and the fried bread slice. Pulse until combined but still chunky.3. Add the tomatoes and pulse to combine. Then add the remaining oil and vinegar and pulse. The mixture will emulsify quickly. Add the salt, cayenne, and smoked paprika, if using. The romesco sauce should be thick but also have a slightly viscous quality. If it seems on the thick side, add 1 to 2 tablespoons of water. Taste for salt and heat and acid and season accordingly. You can cover and refrigerate the romesco for up to 5 days. It just gets better and better with every day the flavors are allowed to meld.4. Slice the remaining loaf of bread, allowing 1 to 2 pieces per person, and grill or toast until lightly browned. Serve with the romesco."

Place 2 tablespoons butter in cake pan and place in oven until melted. Remove from oven, swirl to coat pan, and set aside.                                                                                                                            2                                                                            To make cake: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, cream together butter and brown sugar until fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add egg, vanilla, and sour cream and beat to combine. Add dry ingredients and beat until just incorporated. Batter will be thick.                                                                                                                            3                                                                            To assemble: Sprinkle 1/3 cup brown sugar for topping over melted butter in pan. Pour in blueberries and shake pan until they're evenly spread around. Pour in batter, using a rubber spatula to smooth over blueberries.                                                                                                                             4                                                                            Bake cake until golden and a cake tester inserted into the middle of the cake comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Let cool 15 minutes then release from pan, blueberries on top."

Leave to marinate at room temperature for about 10 mins. Heat a heavy-based ovenproof frying pan until searingly hot.Add the meat to the pan, with oil from the plate, the garlic cloves, thyme and bay leaf. Sear the steak for 3 mins on the first side until well browned, basting with the oil and herbs as it cooks. Carefully tip off the oil, add another 2 tbsp, then sear the second side of the steak in the same way. Quickly brown around the edges, then slide the pan into the oven and roast for 15 mins, turning over halfway through.Take the steak from the pan and sit it on a rack over a roasting tin. Tip the oil, herbs and garlic from the pan over the steak, then leave to rest for 15-20 mins. Leave the steak uncovered – covering with foil will make the steak steam and lose its crisp crust.Meanwhile, start the hollandaise. Put a medium pan of water on to boil. Put the vinegar, basil stalks, bay leaf and spices into a small pan. Boil down to about 3 tbsp, then strain. Put the egg yolks into a large, deep bowl, add 1 tbsp cold water and 1 tbsp of the vinegar reduction, then whisk briefly until light and frothy.Put the bowl over, but not touching, the simmering water, then whisk to a light, airy foam. Now gradually add the butter, little by little, whisking all the time to make a silky yellow sauce. Prevent the sauce overheating by lifting the bowl on and off the pan, adding a splash more water if it starts to get too thick. The sauce can be kept warm for up to 30 mins by sitting the bowl in a bath of just-warm water. If it gets too hot, the sauce will split. Just before serving, finely chop the basil and stir into the sauce with the lemon juice and seasoning to taste.HOLLANDAISE TIP: This recipe makes enough reduction for threebatches of sauce – keep what’s left over in thefridge for several months. We make huge batchesin our restaurants, reducing to 100ml, adding alittle water and storing in a squeezy bottle. Leftover hollandaise will keep well in thefridge for up to 2 days. Try stirring it through somemash to top a fish pie."

If some won't mix in add another tablespoon of water. This batter will be really thick.Spread it out on the bottom of the pan. Pat the dough into place.In another mixing bowl add all of the filling ingredients except the pecans. Whisk together until all is blended together. This will take a couple of minutes with a mixer or a whisk. Add the pecans. Stir in. Spread out on top of brownie base, getting the pecans as even as you can.Mix together the cheesecake mixture in a mixing bowl until thoroughly combined. Drop by large tablespoons over pecan filling like shown in the picture above. Carefully put this in the oven.Bake until the center shakes slightly. If you touch down on the cheesecake part it will feel firm. It will just be starting to turn brown. Start checking this at about 50 minutes. Mine took 1 hour and 10 minutes."

Bake the potatoes until soft, about 1 hour.Meanwhile, in a large soup pot, brown the bacon over medium heat. Add the carrots, celery and onions. Season with salt and pepper and cook until the vegetables are translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the chicken, thyme and broth; bring to a simmer and skim any foam that rises to the top. Reduce the heat and barely simmer until the chicken is cooked through, about 40 minutes. Discard the thyme. Remove the chicken and let cool. Pull off the meat and shred into bite-sized pieces; cover and set aside. Season the broth with salt and pepper.Melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add the breadcrumbs and cook, stirring, until toasted, about 3 minutes; set aside. Halve the baked potatoes and scoop the flesh into a bowl; mash with a fork and season with salt and pepper. Sift the flour over the potatoes and add the toasted crumbs, parmesan and nutmeg; lightly knead to make a firm dough. Roll into 1/2-inch-wide cylinders; cut into 1/2-inch pieces and round the edges to make oval-shaped gnocchi. Bring the soup to a boil and drop in the gnocchi. Cook until they float to the top, 1 to 2 minutes; transfer the gnocchi to warm bowls with a slotted spoon.Beat the eggs with a fork; use the fork to \"paint\" ribbons of egg across the soup. Let set, about 30 seconds. Stir in the chicken meat, parsley, basil and spinach; season with salt and pepper. Ladle the soup over the gnocchi. Serve with lemon wedges and more Parmesan.Photograph by Yunhee Kim                                                    Recipe courtesy of Alexandra Guarnaschelli for Food Network Magazine                         CATEGORIES:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Chicken                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Lunch                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Soup                                                                                                                                                                                                                        View All         <div class=\"popover-content categories\">                        <ul>                    <li>Main Ingredient</li>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <li class=\"last\"><a href=\"/content/food/topics/j/jerk-chicken-recipes.html\">Chicken</a></li>                                 </ul>                <ul>                    <li>Course</li>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <li ><a href=\"/content/food/topics/e/easy-lunch.html\">Lunch</a></li>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 <li class=\"last\"><a href=\"/content/food/topics/m/main-dish.html\">Main Dish</a></li>                                 </ul>                <ul>                    <li>Dish</li>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <li class=\"last\"><a href=\"/content/food/topics/s/soup.html\">Soup</a></li>                                 </ul>                <ul>                    <li>Cuisine</li>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <li class=\"last\"><a href=\"/content/food/topics/i/italian.html\">Italian</a></li>                                 </ul></div>"

Line an 8x8 baking dish with foil or parchment and spray with a non-stick cooking spray.Line the baking dish with the (unwrapped) Reese's cups, 4 rows of 4.Pour the batter over the Reese's cups. GENTLY spread out evenly, trying not to move the Reese's cups too much.Bake according to brownie recipe (on box or otherwise).Put the hot fudge sauce and 1/4 cup peanut butter in a small microwave safe bowl. Heat in the microwave for 30 seconds, or until sauce and peanut butter are melted enough to easily mix. Stir until combined. Pour evenly over the brownies.Heat the remaining (1/4 cup) peanut butter until melted. Drizzle over the hot fudge-peanut butter layer. Swirl with a knife. Serve warm (will be messy, but totally worth it with ice cream!) or let cool completely before cutting into squares and serving. Store in an airtight container for up to a week."

Add chicken sausage to the mixture. When the pan starts to dry, Add 2 tablespoons of Apple Cider and the apple. Cook for about 7 – 10 minutes, just until sausage is cooked and apple is tender. Add bread, and coat until moist.In a small bowl scrape out the acorn squash; be careful not to break through the walls of the squash. Place it in a bowl; add your sausage mixture; stir until combined. Add goat cheese; mix well. Spoon the mixture back into each half of the acorn squash. Place in baking dish, stuffed side up. Add 1/4 cup water to the bottom of the dish, Bake uncovered for 20 minutes. Note: I f half way through baking the bottom of the dish is dry, add more water."

Set aside 250g to stuff the turkey, then press the remainder into a well buttered baking tin or dish, about 20 x 30cm, or use 2 smaller tins if that’s all that you have.Wrap half a bacon rasher around each sausage. Score the stuffing into 8 rectangles, then sit a sausage on top of each. Cover with foil and cook for 20 mins. Uncover, then roast for 20 mins more or until the sausages and bacon are golden and the stuffing golden and sizzling."

Fry each patty in the melted butter until meat has reached an internal temperature of 160 degrees F (72 degrees C), about 6 minutes each side. These can be served either hot or cold.                                                Kitchen-Friendly View"

Add onions, garlic, and mushrooms and saute until onions start to brown and soften. Stir in flour and cook 1 minute. Stir in the broth and Worcestershire sauce. Add the sour cream and stir until melted and smooth. Add the cream/milk and cheese. Stir until the cheese is melted. Add salt to taste (I use roughly 1 teaspoon). If the mixture is not thick enough, boil for another few minutes. Add the green beans.Spoon into the casserole dish and bake 25-30 minutes or until the beans are fork tender.Meanwhile, separate the shallot slices into rings. In a clean skillet, melt the remaining 2 tablespoons butter and cook the shallots until golden brown. Sprinkle with some salt then place on top of casserole."

      "instructions": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Butter a 9 by 13 inch baking pan.Make the crust. In a small bowl, combine the sugar and orange and lemon zest. Rub the sugar and zest together with your fingers until it is distributed throughout and fragrant.In the bowl of a food processor, pulse to combine the sugar and zest mixture, flour, and salt. Add the butter and pulse until the butter is evenly distributed and no bigger than the size of peas, about 15 times. The food processor bowl will be extremely full, so take caution. If you have a small processor and it does not fit, use a pastry cutter or forks to make the dough in a large bowl. After pulsing there may still be a few larger pieces of butter. Mix them in with your fingers. Reserve 1 ½ cups of the shortbread for the topping. Place it in the refrigerator until it is ready to be used. Press the remainder of the crust in the bottom of the pan. It will form a thick layer. Bake for 15-20 minutes, until lightly golden brown. Cool while preparing the filling.Make the filling. Combine the eggs, sugar, sour cream, flour, salt, and vanilla in a large bowl. Stir until there is a homogeneous mixture. Very gently fold in the blackberries to prevent breaking as much as possible, though some is inevitable. Pour the mixture over the crust. Even out as much as possible. Distribute reserved shortbread evenly over filling.Bake 50-60 minutes, until the top is lightly browned and the edges are golden brown. It will still be very jiggly. Cool for at least 1 hour before cutting into bars. May be served warm, at room temperature, or cold. May be stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 days, or frozen, wrapped in parchment and foil and placed in a zipper bag for up to 3 months. Thaw at room temperature for about an hour."

Rub the herb mix all over the flesh then scatter with the remaining whole thyme leaves. Neatly roll the meat into a joint surrounded by the skin then use butchers' string to tie the joint tightly at regular intervals to hold the joint together. Cover and chill, leaving to marinate for a few hours or overnight. When ready to cook, rub the skin of the joint with plenty of salt and 1 tbsp remaining olive oil. Put it on a wire rack and roast at 200C/180C fan/gas 6 for 30 mins. After this time, squeeze the lemons over the skin and turn the heat down to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Roast for a further 2 hrs. Finally turn the heat back up to 220C/200C fan/gas 7 and give it a final blast for another 30 mins or so, to finish the crisping of the skin. Allow to rest somewhere warm for 20 mins. Carve up into thick slices and serve with your favourite roast dinner accompaniments."

Press in gently. Don't worry if it breaks, take a little of the extra bread to do a little patch work if needed.Lightly mist the bread cups with oil again, and bake in the oven for 10 minutes.Meanwhile, make the filling. In a medium bowl, mix together all the other ingredients.Remove the bread cups from the oven, add about 1 tsp of filling to each cup.Return the tarts to the oven and bake for 10-11 minutes until the cheese is melted and its puffed up slightly.Remove from the pan and place on a dish. Serve warm.Extra's can be frozen and re-heated at a later date."

Butter an 8-inch square baking dish with 1 teaspoon butter. Cut a piece of parchment paper in a strip to line the bottom and 2 sides of the dish. Butter the paper with the remaining 1/2 teaspoon butter and set aside.Place the unsweetened chocolate and 8 tablespoons butter in a medium heat-proof bowl that fits comfortably over a saucepan filled with 1 inch water. Place the double-boiler over medium heat and cook, stirring constantly with a silicone spatula, until the chocolate and butter are just barely melted. Remove the bowl from the heat and continue to stir for 1 minute to cool slightly. The mixture should be warm to the touch, not hot.Using a hand-held mixer, beat the sugar, vanilla and salt into the chocolate mixture until smooth. Add the eggs and yolk all at once and beat until fully incorporated and smooth. Fold in the flour and semisweet chocolate chips with a silicone spatula until just barely combined; a few streaks are fine. Pour the mixture into the prepared pan and bake on the middle rack until just set and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Do not overbake. Allow to cool to room temperature before cutting into 16 small pieces.

      "instructions": "***Please note that my baguette wasn't extremely wide so my portions were small.Start by heating your oven at 425F.Take your slices of bread and with a brush, lightly brush olive oil on each side (use more than indicated if need be).sprinkle chopped garlic on bread slices and place them on a baking pan. Once oven is heated to temperature, turn it to low-broil and place your baking pan in the middle of your oven, for about 7-8 minutes.When the crostinis are done baking, take them out and turn your oven back down to 400F.Place your cleaned blueberries on a baking pan with parchment paper.Bake for about 8 minutes. You want most of them to be whole since it looks prettier.While your berries are baking, place your pecan pieces and maple syrup in a pan and heat up on medium high until maple syrup bubbles. It should take about 1 minute on a gas stovetop. Mix them well while they heat up to make sure they are well coated with maple syrup.Remove them from the heat immediately and place them on a piece of parchment paper. Try to separate them as much as you can without touching them with your fingers (they will be hot!).Let them cool for about 5 minutes and try to separate them some more.In a food processor, place your goat cheese and about 3/4 of your chopped basil. Process until it makes a uniform paste. remove cheese mixture from processor and when the crostinis are cool enough, coat them with the cheese mixture.Add blueberries on top of crostinis, then sprinkle some pecans. Drizzle honey and sprinkle a bit of basil.Tada! Enjoy!"
