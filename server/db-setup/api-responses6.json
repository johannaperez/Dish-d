Scrape down the bowl, add the melted chocolate, and mix it in by hand with a rubber spatula. Divide the batter evenly into the prepared molds. Bake for 22 - 25 minutes, or until the tops of the cakes are springy and a tester inserted in the centers comes out clean. Transfer the muffin pan to a cooling rack and allow the cakes to cool for 5 minutes before unmolding them. Cool to room temperature before glazing.                                                                                                                            3                                                                            Make the glaze: Melt the chocolate in a heatproof bowl over a saucepan of simmering water.Transfer the bowl to the counter and allow it to sit for five minutes. Stir in sifted confectioner's sugar, followed by pieces of cold butter. Stir until the butter completely disappears into the chocolate. Use a small spatula to spread the glaze on the cupcakes or dip them if the glaze seems very thin (if you'd prefer, allow the glaze to cool more, then spread.)"},{"vegetarian":false,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":false,"dairyFree":false,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":false,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":12,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":false,"servings":12,"preparationMinutes":30,"cookingMinutes":20,"sourceUrl":"http://www.cookingclassy.com/2013/05/coconut-key-lime-cupcakes/","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/coconut-key-lime-pie-cupcakes-543327","aggregateLikes":214,"creditText":"Cooking Classy","sourceName":"Cooking Classy","extendedIngredients":[{"id":12104,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/coconut.jpg","name":"coconut","amount":0.25,"unit":"tsp","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"1/4 tsp coconut extract","metaInformation":[]},{"id":98880,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/evaporated-milk.jpg","name":"condensed skim milk","amount":0.875,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"1 3/4 cup + 2 Tbsp sweetened condensed milk (don't use low fat, this is 1 1/2 14 oz cans)","metaInformation":["sweetened","low fat,","(don't use this is 1 1/2 14 oz cans)"]},{"id":1125,"aisle":"Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/hard-boiled-egg.jpg","name":"egg yolks","amount":6,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"6 large egg yolks","metaInformation":["large"]},{"id":18942,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pie-crust-graham-cracker.jpg","name":"graham cracker crust","amount":7,"unit":"sheets","unitShort":"sheets","unitLong":"sheets","originalString":"7 graham cracker sheets, broken into halves","metaInformation":[]},{"id":1053,"aisle":"Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/fluid-cream.jpg","name":"heavy cream","amount":1,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cup","originalString":"1 cup heavy cream","metaInformation":[]},{"id":19334,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-sugar-dark.jpg","name":"light-brown sugar","amount":1.5,"unit":"Tbsp","unitShort":"Tbsp","unitLong":"Tbsps","originalString":"1 1/2 Tbsp light-brown sugar","metaInformation":[]},{"id":9160,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/lime-juice.jpg","name":"lime juice","amount":0.75,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"3/4 cup fresh lime juice or key lime juice","metaInformation":["fresh"]},{"id":1009159,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/zest-lime.jpg","name":"lime zest","amount":1.5,"unit":"Tbsp","unitShort":"Tbsp","unitLong":"Tbsps","originalString":"1 1/2 Tbsp lime zest","metaInformation":[]},{"id":19336,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/powdered-sugar.jpg","name":"powdered sugar","amount":3,"unit":"Tbsp","unitShort":"Tbsp","unitLong":"Tbsps","originalString":"3 Tbsp powdered sugar","metaInformation":[]},{"id":1001001,"aisle":"Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter.jpg","name":"salted butter","amount":4,"unit":"Tbsp","unitShort":"Tbsp","unitLong":"Tbsps","originalString":"4 Tbsp salted butter, melted","metaInformation":["salted","melted"]},{"id":12179,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/coconut-shredded.jpg","name":"sweetened shredded coconut","amount":1,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cup","originalString":"1 cup shredded sweetened coconut, divided","metaInformation":["shredded","sweetened","divided"]},{"id":2050,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla-extract.jpg","name":"vanilla extract","amount":0.5,"unit":"tsp","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"1/2 tsp vanilla extract","metaInformation":[]}],"id":543327,"title":"Coconut Key Lime Pie Cupcakes","readyInMinutes":300,"image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Coconut-Key-Lime-Pie-Cupcakes-543327.jpg","imageType":"jpg","cuisines":["american"],"instructions":"Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Spread coconut in an even layer on a rimmed baking sheet and toast in preheated oven 6 - 8 minutes until golden brown, stirring once halfway through baking. Remove from oven and transfer to a bowl.In a non-reactive mixing bowl whisk together lime zest and egg yolks for 2 minutes, until mixture is slightly tinted green, Stir in sweetened condensed milk. Pour in lime juice, vanilla and coconut extract (for more coconut flavor you can add an additional 1/4 tsp coconut extract) and mix until well blended. Allow mixture to rest 30 minutes, without stirring, at room temperature to allow to thicken.Meanwhile prepare graham cracker crust by placing graham crackers and 1/4 cup toasted coconut in a food processor and pulse until finely ground, about 30 - 40 seconds. Add in light-brown sugar and melted butter and pulse just until mixture is evenly coated. Divide mixture among 12 paper lined muffin cups, spooning about 1 heaping Tbsp mixture into each cup, and press mixture into an even layer. Bake in 350 degree oven for 5 minutes. Remove from oven and allow to cool. Reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees. Divide lime pie filling among 12 cups, pouring mixture over graham cracker crust layer and filling each cup nearly full (about 1/4 cup in each). Bake in preheated oven 14 - 16 minutes, or until cupcakes only jiggle slightly. Remove from oven and allow to cool to room temperature, about 45 minutes. Once cool cover loosely with plastic wrap and transfer to refrigerator and chill 3 hours (note, I chilled mine in the muffin pan but the butter from the crust made the cups stick to the bottoms of the pan once it was chilled - so I simply poured hot water into a cookie sheet then set the muffin pan over the warm water and removed them after about 20 seconds. You could probably lift them off of a plate easier though if you put them on a plate before refrigerating :). In a mixing bowl, using an electric hand mixer, whip heavy cream on high speed until soft peaks form. Add powdered sugar (if you want more coconut flavor you can add 1/4 tsp coconut extract to the whipped cream along with the sugar), whip until stiff peaks form. Just before serving, spoon or pipe whipped cream over cupcakes and sprinkle tops with remaining toasted coconut. Garnish with lime slices if desired.Recipe Source: adapted lightly from Cook's Illustrated via Sweet Pea's Kitchen"},{"vegetarian":false,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":false,"dairyFree":false,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":false,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":18,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":false,"servings":24,"preparationMinutes":30,"cookingMinutes":18,"sourceUrl":"http://www.frombraziltoyou.org/frozen-cupcakes-party-ideas/","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/frozen-cupcakes-608038","aggregateLikes":59,"creditText":"From Brazil to You","sourceName":"From Brazil to You","extendedIngredients":[{"id":18372,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg","name":"baking soda","amount":1,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoon","originalString":"1 teaspoon baking soda","metaInformation":[]},{"id":1230,"aisle":"Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/buttermilk.jpg","name":"buttermilk","amount":0.5,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"½ cup buttermilk","metaInformation":[]},{"id":19165,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cocoa-powder.jpg","name":"cocoa powder","amount":0.5,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"½ cup unsweetened baking cocoa powder","metaInformation":["unsweetened"]},{"id":1123,"aisle":"Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg","name":"eggs","amount":2,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"2 large eggs, at room temperature","metaInformation":["large","at room temperature"]},{"id":20081,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png","name":"flour","amount":1.5,"unit":"cups","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"1½ cups all-purpose flour","metaInformation":["all-purpose"]},{"id":93644,"aisle":"Nut butters, Jams, and Honey","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/no.jpg","name":"marshmallow creme","amount":7,"unit":"ounce","unitShort":"oz","unitLong":"ounces","originalString":"2 ( 7- ounce) jars of marshmallow creme","metaInformation":[]},{"id":19125,"aisle":"Nut butters, Jams, and Honey","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/hazelnut-chocolate-spread.jpg","name":"nutella","amount":0.25,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"¼ cup Nutella","metaInformation":[]},{"id":19336,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/powdered-sugar.jpg","name":"powdered sugar","amount":4,"unit":"cups","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"4 cups powdered sugar, sifted","metaInformation":["sifted"]},{"id":2047,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg","name":"salt","amount":0.25,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"¼ teaspoon salt","metaInformation":[]},{"id":2047,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg","name":"salt","amount":1,"unit":"pinch","unitShort":"pinch","unitLong":"pinch","originalString":"A pinch of salt","metaInformation":[]},{"id":19335,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg","name":"sugar","amount":1.5,"unit":"cups","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"1½ cups sugar","metaInformation":[]},{"id":1145,"aisle":"Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg","name":"unsalted butter","amount":2,"unit":"cups","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"2 cups unsalted butter, softened","metaInformation":["unsalted","softened"]},{"id":2050,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla-extract.jpg","name":"vanilla extract","amount":2,"unit":"teaspoons","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract","metaInformation":["pure"]},{"id":14412,"aisle":"Beverages","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/water.jpg","name":"water","amount":0.5,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"½ cup water","metaInformation":[]}],"id":608038,"title":"Frozen Cupcakes","readyInMinutes":48,"image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Frozen-Cupcakes-608038.jpg","imageType":"jpg","cuisines":["american"],"instructions":"Preheat oven to 375° F (190° C).Prepare the chocolate cupcake batter: In the bowl of a stand mixer with a paddle attachment, cream softened butter and sugar together until light and fluffy.

chicken into bite-size pieces. Beat together the egg white and 1 tbsp cornflour in a bowl. Tip in the chicken and coat with the mix (see Know-how, top right). Marinate for 15-30 mins (don’t place in the fridge or the mix will harden). Now rinse the rice in a sieve under the cold tap until the water runs clear.Making perfect rice: Drain the rice,tip into a pan with a lid and pour over600ml water and a pinch of salt. Bring thewater to the boil, then cook the rice uncoveredfor 10 mins or so until the water has almostboiled away and small craters appear. Coverwith a lid, turn the heat down as low as itwill go and cook for 10 mins more.Getting the ingredients ready: Strip the ginger skin with a teaspoon and finely chop until you have 1 tbsp. Halve the pepper and trim off the stalk, inner pith and seeds. Cut into bite-size pieces. Peel theshallot and garlic clove, then thinly slice. Trim the ends off the chilli, if using, removing the seeds if you like it milder, and cut into thin slices. Remove the chicken from the eggmarinade and pat dry with kitchen paper.Foolproof stir-frying: Heat a wok and pour in 1 tbsp oil. Cook the chicken for 7-10 mins, tossing until just cooked. Set aside. Pour in some more oil if you need to. Add the pepper and cook for 1 min, then cook the ginger, shallot and garlic for 1-2 mins more. Combine the fish sauce, lime juice, 50ml water and 1 tsp cornflour. Tip into the wok, then add the chicken. Cook for 1 min, stir through the basil, then serve with the rice."},{"vegetarian":false,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":false,"dairyFree":false,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":false,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":19,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":false,"servings":4,"preparationMinutes":10,"cookingMinutes":35,"sourceUrl":"http://www.lifesambrosia.com/2015/11/sausage-pesto-pizza-recipe.html","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/sausage-pesto-pizza-691100","aggregateLikes":160,"creditText":"Lifes Ambrosia","sourceName":"Lifes Ambrosia","extendedIngredients":[{"id":10011693,"aisle":"Canned and Jarred","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/tomatoes-canned.jpg","name":"canned tomatoes","amount":15,"unit":"ounce","unitShort":"oz","unitLong":"ounces","originalString":"1 (15 ounce) can diced tomatoes, drained","metaInformation":["diced","drained","canned"]},{"id":1032009,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/red-pepper-flakes.jpg","name":"crushed red pepper","amount":0.25,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper","metaInformation":["red","crushed"]},{"id":11215,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg","name":"garlic cloves","amount":2,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"2 garlic cloves, minced","metaInformation":["minced"]},{"id":7063,"aisle":"Meat","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/raw-pork-sausage.jpg","name":"ground sausage","amount":0.5,"unit":"pound","unitShort":"lb","unitLong":"pounds","originalString":"1/2 pound ground Italian sausage","metaInformation":["italian"]},{"id":1026,"aisle":"Cheese","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/mozzarella-fresh.jpg","name":"mozzarella","amount":1,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cup","originalString":"1 cup diced mozzarella (1/2 inch pieces)","metaInformation":["diced","(1/2 inch pieces)"]},{"id":4053,"aisle":"Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg","name":"olive oil","amount":1,"unit":"tablespoon","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoon","originalString":"1 tablespoon olive oil","metaInformation":[]},{"id":93698,"aisle":"Pasta and Rice","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pesto.jpg","name":"pesto","amount":0.25,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"1/4 cup pesto","metaInformation":[]},{"id":93610,"aisle":"Refrigerated","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pizza-dough.jpg","name":"pizza dough","amount":1,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"1 homemade or store-bought pizza dough","metaInformation":["homemade","store-bought"]},{"id":2047,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg","name":"salt","amount":0.5,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"1/2 teaspoon salt","metaInformation":[]}],"id":691100,"title":"Sausage Pesto Pizza","readyInMinutes":45,"image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/sausage-pesto-pizza-691100.jpg","imageType":"jpg","cuisines":["mediterranean","european","italian"],"instructions":"Preheat oven to 430 degrees.

Add juice, zest, salt and sugar, stir well and allow to stand 20 minutes.  Line a conical sieve with cheesecloth and pour tepid mixture through, allowing the whey to drain through. (Save this for your pet).  Allow to stand at room temperature for 2 hours and press lightly to form conical shape.  Turn out onto plate and cover with wax paper.  This is best eaten the day it's made but will last several days in the refrigerator.                                                    Recipe copyright 2000, Mario Batali.

Place sweet potato on a small plan lined with foil and bake in the oven for 30-45 minutes or until fork tender.While sweet potato is cooking, cook the wild rice by adding 1 cup water and wild rice to a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil, then cover, reduce heat to low and simmer for 30-40 minutes or until tender.Add cooked sweet potato (not the skin) and chickpeas to a large bowl; mash with a fork or potato masher. (Alternatively you can use a food processor and pulse them until somewhat, but not completely smooth.) Next stir in cooked wild rice, curry powder, cumin and garlic powder. Add salt and pepper to taste. Then stir in breadcrumbs (or oat flour), cranberries and pecans, if using. The pecans add a lovely flavor, but aren't necessary. Shape mixture into six patties. It's easier to shape and cook the patties when they are cold, so if you'd like you can keep the mixture in the fridge until cold then form patties (I recommend doing it this way!).Heat coconut oil over medium heat in a large pan. Once oil is hot, add patties and cook for about 7-9 minutes, then VERY carefully flip. Cook for an additional 7-9 minutes on the other side, adding more oil to the pan if necessary.

Once cookie sheet is filled placein the freezer for 10 minutes to become firm.While the pan is in the freezer, microwave 1/3 of the chocolate chips in a microwave safe bowl at 30 second intervals, stirring in between, for a total of 1 minute 30 seconds. Chocolate should be smooth at this point. Place a small amount into a zip-lock baggie. Snip a corner of the the bag, slightly larger than a pin hole, and begin outlining and filling in the stencils.(Be sure to flip paper over, do not outline on side of pencil lining or will come off onto chocolate).Place in refrigerator to harden, until ready to create bats.With remaining chocolate chips, microwave as stated above.Remove Oreo balls from the freezer and dip each individually into chocolate, coating all sides. Place on a parchment lined paper.Immediatelyadhere bat wings to sides and eyeballs on front.

(half-sheet size) with parchment paper or silpat mats.  Set aside.In a large bowl (I used my 6qt stand mixer), combine water, yeast, oil and sugar.  Let sit for 10 minutes.Add eggs, flour and salt, and mix for 10 minutes.  I used the dough hook on my stand mixer.  You can also do this by hand, with a wooden spoon until it all comes together, and then a kneading motion for the rest of the time.Pour dough onto a floured surface, and knead until dough is soft, smooth and not too sticky.  Only add additional flour if it's unworkable and sticking to the surface and your hands.  Roll dough into a large rectangle, approximately 18x26 inches.In a small bowl, stir together pecan pieces and Karo Syrup.  Set aside.Spread melted butter over the top of the dough.  Then, top with brown sugar, white sugar and cinnamon. Spoon pecans over dough, and spread slightly.Roll the dough into a log.  Cut into 24 1-inch pieces.Place rolls on to prepared cookie sheets.  Cover them with clean towels and set aside to rise for 20 minutes in a warm, draft-free spot.Meanwhile, preheat oven to 400 degrees (F).Bake for 12-20 minutes or until golden brown.  {The original recipe called for just 10-12 minutes, but I had to bake mine for 20 minutes and they were perfect.}Combine all ingredients in a medium sized bowl.
