425 Fahrenheit.Cut the squash in 2 halves, scrape out the seeds and the fiber out of each half. Spray oil over the cut sides of the squash. Spray the baking sheet with oil and place the squash on the baking sheet cut side down.Bake for about 30-40 minutes. Remove it from the oven when it's cooked through and soft, and let it cool. Flip the squash so that cut side faces up  that will speed up the cooling. After squash cools, scrape squash with a fork to remove flesh in long strands and transfer to a bowl. Let it cool.Important:  Wring out the spaghetti squash by wrapping portions of it in paper towels and squeezing hard with your hands over the sink.  Be careful not to drop the spaghetti squash into the sink if the paper towel breaks. Try to get rid of as much liquid as you can.Cooked spaghetti squash can be refrigerated for 5 days.  I prefer to cook spaghetti squash, refrigerate it and make fritters the next day or 2 days later - that allows spaghetti squash to drain the liquid out and get dryer, which is preferable for frittersIn a large bowl, using electric mixer, beat 2 eggs on high speed for 1-2 minutes.  Add flour and continue beating for about 30 seconds to combine.  To the same bowl, add spaghetti squash, Parmesan cheese, 3 chopped green onions, and 1/4 + 1/8 teaspoons salt.  Mix very well until all the mixture has uniform consistency.  Add chopped bacon and mix.  Taste and adjust seasoning, if necessary, even though it should be just perfect.Heat a large skillet on high-medium heat until VERY hot.  Only then add olive oil.  It should sizzle and smoke right away.  Using a tablespoon, spoon the tablespoon-ful of the batter for each fritter and drop on the skillet.  Using a spatula, correct the shape of each fritter, making it flatter and rounder.   Cook until the bottom side of each fritter is golden brown, about 1-2 minutes.  Reduce heat to medium.  Using spatula, flip fritters to the opposite side, and cook 1-2 more minutes.  When flipping the fritters, you can use a spoon on the opposite side of spatula to help push each fritter onto the spatula and then flipping.   Turn off the heat and let the fritters sit in the skillet (uncovered) for 2-3 more minutes (check the bottom to make sure it's not burned - if it is too dark, remove fritters from the skillet immediately).  Do 4 fritters at a time, you should have a total of 2 batches (8 fritters total).Serve as is, or top with the dollop of Greek yogurt and chopped green onions (delicious if served this way!)."},{"vegetarian":false,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":true,"dairyFree":false,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":true,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":13,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":false,"servings":4,"sourceUrl":"http://www.foodiecrush.com/2013/10/tabasco-brined-spicy-drumsticks/","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/tabasco-brined-spicy-drumsticks-532616","aggregateLikes":1079,"creditText":"Foodie Crush","sourceName":"Foodie Crush","extendedIngredients":[{"id":1001004,"aisle":"Cheese","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/blue-cheese.png","name":"blue cheese crumbles","amount":1,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cup","originalString":"1 cup blue cheese crumbles","metaInformation":[]},{"id":4582,"aisle":"Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vegetable-oil.jpg","name":"canola oil","amount":1.5,"unit":"tablespoons","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoons","originalString":"1 1/2 tablespoons canola oil","metaInformation":[]},{"id":5066,"aisle":"Meat","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chicken-drumsticks.jpg","name":"chicken drumsticks","amount":10,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"10-12 chicken drumsticks","metaInformation":[]},{"id":11291,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/green-onion.jpg","name":"green onion","amount":1,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"1 green onion, chopped for garnish","metaInformation":["green","chopped","for garnish"]},{"id":1082047,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg","name":"kosher salt","amount":0.5,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"½ cup kosher salt","metaInformation":[]},{"id":1082047,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg","name":"kosher salt","amount":4,"unit":"servings","unitShort":"servings","unitLong":"servings","originalString":"kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper","metaInformation":["black","freshly ground"]},{"id":6168,"aisle":"Condiments","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/hot-sauce-or-tabasco.png","name":"tabasco sauce","amount":4,"unit":"tablespoons","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoons","originalString":"4 tablespoons Tabasco Original Red Sauce, plus 10 shakes","metaInformation":["red"]},{"id":14412,"aisle":"Beverages","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/water.jpg","name":"water","amount":1,"unit":"gallon","unitShort":"gallon","unitLong":"gallon","originalString":"1 gallon water","metaInformation":[]}],"id":532616,"title":"Tabasco Brined Spicy Drumsticks","readyInMinutes":45,"image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Tabasco-Brined-Spicy-Drumsticks-532616.jpg","imageType":"jpg","cuisines":[],"instructions":"Mix the water, kosher salt and the 4 tablespoons of Tabasco in a large bowl or stockpot fitted with a lid.

combining the flour, yeast and water. Mix by hand or with a stand mixer with a dough hook to form a dough that sticks a little to the bottom while mixing. Add more water or flour to achieve that consistency. Place in an oiled covered bowl and set in a warm place for an hour or two until doubled in size. Punch down, cover and place in the refrigerator overnight.Four to five hours before serving, remove Biga from the refrigerator and cut into golf ball sized pieces and lay out on your counter. Cover with plastic and a towel and let come up to room temperature for 45 minutes.While Biga is coming to room temperature, measure out all of your ingredients and prepare milk and butter by combining in a microwave safe bowl and microwaving until hot and the butter has melted. Set aside to cool to room temperature.In a small bowl, combine water and yeast.In a medium bowl, combine eggs, egg yolks, sugar and salt. Using an electric mixer or by hand whip for about three minutes or until the mixture turns pale.To the egg mixture, add nutmeg, both extracts, both zests and orange liquor and stir to combine.Place all six cups of flour on your counter and make a large well in the center.Mix and stir as you go and add each of the three bowls a little at a time starting with warm yeast and water, then cooled milk and butter and finally eggs and sugar mixture, pulling the sides into the center over and over to form a dough.Add the pieces of Biga to the dough working them in as you press and turn. This process will take a good five minutes working the dough to completely blend together. (If using a 6 or 7 quart stand mixer, the process will take less time).The dough now needs to be kneaded for five additional minutes. Pull the back of the dough to the front and press with the heel of your palm over and over working the dough for five minutes. This step is necessary.Oil a large bowl and place the dough ball in and swirl to coat all sides with oil.Cover with plastic and a towel and place in a warm place for at least two hours or until doubled in size.In a medium bowl place both raisins, currants and rum, cover and microwave one minute on high. Set aside covered at room temperature.Once the dough has doubled in size, generously flour your counter and pour out the dough. Cut into three equal pieces, about 1  pounds each.One at a time, roll out each piece of dough to 9 inches wide by 13 inches long.Divide the raisin mixture into thirds and place one third over the rolled out dough bringing it right to the sides. Discard any liquid in the bowl, if any.Do the same for the chopped nuts; dividing in thirds and sprinkling to the edges.Take the long end and roll tightly towards the center. Take the other long end and do the same so that both rolls end in the center.Gently lift and place in a loaf pan, seam side up.Brush a little water between the seam and pinch together to seal.Repeat this procedure for the other two loaves.Cover with plastic and a dish towel and let proof for 90 minutes or until almost doubled in size.Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.Beat the egg with the water and brush the tops of each loaf, trying not to let the egg wash leak down the sides.Place all three in the center of the oven and bake for 30-35 minutes or until golden brown and when tapped, sounds hollow. Half way through baking, rotate pans so that they brown evenly. Ours took 33 minutes.Cool for a few minutes on a rack then invert out of the pan and cool.Once cool, bread should be tightly wrapped. Can be frozen if baking ahead."},{"vegetarian":false,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":true,"dairyFree":true,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":true,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":4,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":false,"servings":4,"preparationMinutes":25,"cookingMinutes":3,"sourceUrl":"http://www.recipegirl.com/2007/06/03/sweet-spicy-chicken-lettuce-wraps/","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/sweet-spicy-chicken-lettuce-wraps-517963","aggregateLikes":12881,"creditText":"Recipe Girl","sourceName":"Recipe Girl","extendedIngredients":[{"id":10011250,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/Butter-or-Boston-Bibb-lettuce.jpg","name":"bibb lettuce leaves","amount":12,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"12 Bibb/Butter lettuce leaves","metaInformation":[]},{"id":11109,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cabbage.jpg","name":"cabbage","amount":2,"unit":"cups","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"2 cups thinly sliced cabbage","metaInformation":["thinly sliced"]},{"id":11590,"aisle":"Ethnic Foods","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/water-chestnuts.jpg","name":"canned water chestnuts","amount":1,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cup","originalString":"1 cup canned, sliced water chestnuts, drained","metaInformation":["canned","drained","sliced"]},{"id":11124,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/carrots.jpg","name":"carrot","amount":0.5,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"1/2 cup grated carrot","metaInformation":["grated"]},{"id":5062,"aisle":"Meat","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chicken-breasts.jpg","name":"chicken breast","amount":1,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cup","originalString":"1 cup finely diced cooked chicken breast","metaInformation":["diced","cooked","finely"]},{"id":2048,"aisle":"Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/apple-cider-vinegar.jpg","name":"cider vinegar","amount":2,"unit":"Tablespoons","unitShort":"Tablespoons","unitLong":"Tablespoons","originalString":"2 Tablespoons cider vinegar","metaInformation":[]},{"id":1032009,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/red-pepper-flakes.jpg","name":"crushed red pepper","amount":0.5,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper","metaInformation":["red","crushed"]},{"id":1004058,"aisle":"Ethnic Foods","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sesame-oil.jpg","name":"dark sesame oil","amount":1,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoon","originalString":"1 teaspoon dark sesame oil","metaInformation":["dark"]},{"id":16090,"aisle":"Nuts","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/peanuts.png","name":"dry roasted peanuts","amount":3,"unit":"Tablespoons","unitShort":"Tablespoons","unitLong":"Tablespoons","originalString":"3 Tablespoons unsalted, dry-roasted peanuts, roughly chopped","metaInformation":["unsalted","roughly chopped"]},{"id":11216,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ginger.jpg","name":"fresh ginger","amount":1,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoon","originalString":"1 teaspoon fresh minced ginger","metaInformation":["fresh","minced"]},{"id":11215,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg","name":"garlic","amount":0.5,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"1/2 teaspoon minced garlic","metaInformation":["minced"]},{"id":6175,"aisle":"Ethnic Foods","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/dark-sauce.jpg","name":"hoisin sauce","amount":3,"unit":"Tablespoons","unitShort":"Tablespoons","unitLong":"Tablespoons","originalString":"3 Tablespoons hoisin sauce","metaInformation":[]},{"id":16424,"aisle":"Condiments","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/soy-sauce.jpg","name":"low sodium soy sauce","amount":2,"unit":"teaspoons","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"2 teaspoons low-sodium soy sauce","metaInformation":["low-sodium"]}],"id":517963,"title":"Sweet & Spicy Chicken Lettuce Wraps","readyInMinutes":28,"image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Sweet---Spicy-Chicken-Lettuce-Wraps-517963.jpg","imageType":"jpg","cuisines":[],"instructions":"1.

Drizzle with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and then wrap the beets in the first layer of foil. Transfer the baking sheet to the oven and roast until the beets are fork tender, about 1 hour.Meanwhile, place shallots in a small bowl, drizzle with another 2 tablespoons of the olive oil, and sprinkle with salt and pepper; toss well. After the beets have roasted for 45 minutes, remove the baking sheet from the oven and carefully place the shallots directly on the second layer of aluminum foil. Return to the oven for another 15 minutes, until the shallots are caramelized and soft and the beets are fully cooked.Let the beets cool in the foil for at least 5 minutes. Transfer the shallots to a large bowl and set aside. When the beets are cool enough to handle, use a paper towel to rub off the skins. Cut the beets into wedges and add them to the bowl with the shallots.Trim the tops and bottoms off the oranges with a paring knife or a small serrated knife. Set the oranges on one of the cut ends and carefully cut away the skins, beginning at the top and following the curve of the fruit down to the bottom. Slice the oranges crosswise into thin slices. Set aside.In a small bowl, whisk together the vinegar, sugar, mustard, some salt and pepper, and the remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil. Pour the dressing over the beets and shallots; toss to combine.

                                 For the crust: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line two 12-cup standard muffin tins with paper liners.Combine the graham cracker crumbs, granulated sugar, cinnamon and butter in a small bowl. Drop a heaping tablespoon of graham cracker mixture into each muffin cup. Press to create a firm layer of crust on the bottom. Bake 7 minutes. Set aside to cool completely.For the cupcakes: Combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl.Using a hand mixer or stand mixer, cream the butter and granulated sugar together until fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the eggs, one at a time, scraping down the bowl between additions. Beat in the vanilla.Whisk together the sour cream and the milk. Add the flour mixture and milk mixture in three additions, alternating between wet and dry ingredients and starting and ending with flour mixture. Beat just until well combined, taking care not to overmix.For the filling: Beat the cream cheese and granulated sugar in a bowl with an electric mixer at medium speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Beat in the egg just until combined. Spoon the filling into a pastry bag fitted with a medium-size plain tip (Ateco 800). Insert the tip into the top of each cupcake batter and squeeze the filling until the batter rises to fill each cup about three-quarters of the way up the side of the tin.Bake until lightly golden and a toothpick inserted about 3/4 inch from the edge of the cupcakes comes out clean, 18 to 20 minutes. Cool the cupcakes in the tins on a rack for 10 minutes, and then remove from the tins and cool completely.For the frosting: Using an electric or stand mixer, beat the cream cheese and butter together at medium speed until fluffy, about 2 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl. Beat in the sour cream and lemon juice. On low speed, gradually add the confectioners' sugar and beat until well combined.Frost the cupcakes as desired. Garnish with graham cracker pieces.

Now fry themushrooms until golden, then tip out.Toss the venison in the flour and fry inbatches, adding more oil as you go, untilreally golden brown. Mix the purée, ale,sugar and thyme into the pan, then cool.Now butter a 2½ pt/1.4-litre basin.Roll the suet pastry out to about 1cmthick and use to line the sides of thebasin. Trim so that there’s a littleoverhang. Re-roll what’s left and cut outa lid that’s about 1cm wider than thetop of the basin. Put the mushroomsaround the sides of the basin, stalksfacing in, then fill the basin with meatand juices. You might not need allthe juices.Place the lid on top and crimp theedges together to seal. Make a doublelayer of buttered foil and baking paper,and pleat it in the centre. Scrunch thisover the pudding, foil-side up, then tiewith string under the rim of the basin.Trim to about 2cm under the string, thenput into a steamer or sit on a saucer ina large pan containing enough gentlysimmering water to come halfway upthe sides of the bowl.

Cooking times will vary by microwaves but the mixture should be very warm, but don’t allow it to boil. White chocolate is notorious for scorching so keep a watchful eye. You could do this over the stovetop and low heat, but I prefer the microwave for ease. Stir or whisk the mixture until it’s smooth and the white chocolate chips have melted. Add 1/4 teaspoon peppermint extract and stir to incorporate. Taste the mixture and determine if more is desired. I use about 1/2 teaspoon in this recipe, but this will vary based on brand of extract and personal taste presences. Notes - Peppermint extract is infinitely stronger and more potent than vanilla extract and a little goes a very long way, it cannot be un-done or masked once added, so start slowly, taste the beverage, and add more if desired, to taste. After stirring in the peppermint extract, optionally transfer the mixture to a blender and whirl for about 30 seconds, helping to ensure all white chocolate bits are fully blended, and to create froth. Pour into mugs an optionally garnish with mini-marshmallows.

Whisk to combine.  Pour the boiling water into the saucepan and allow to bubble for a moment then turn off the heat.  Pour the chocolate mixture into the bowl with the flour mixture and stir for just a moment to cool the chocolate.  Slowly add the egg mixture and stir until smooth.Pour the batter into the donut cavities, filling each no more than three-quarters full.  (I use a freezer bag with the corner tip cut off for cleanly piping the batter.)  Depending on the donut pan you have, you may need to work in batches as this recipe yields 2 to 2 1/2 dozen donuts.  Bake for 10 minutes.Remove from oven and let cool in pan for 10 minutes.  After 10 minutes, use a plastic knife to gently remove the donuts to cool completely on a wire rack.  Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat.  Stir in the cocoa powder until smooth.  Pour in the milk and vanilla, then stir in the powdered sugar.  Fold in the pecans.Once the donuts are cooled and the icing is somewhat cooled, layer a sheet of wax paper underneath the cooling racks holding the donuts. Using a spoon, slowly pour desired amount of icing over each donut and allow to drizzle over the sides.  The warmer the icing, the more it will drizzle, so wait another moment if it's too runny.  Try to strategically place the pecans on top of the donuts so they do not fall off.Allow to cool and icing to harden before serving.  Donuts will keep in an airtight container at room temperature for a day or two.

Add the pancetta and saute until brown and crisp, about 8 minutes. Remove the pancetta from the pan and set aside to cool.Add the onions to the pan and cook until golden brown and lightly caramelized, 10 minutes. Add the garlic and 1/2 teaspoon of the salt and cook 2 minutes more. Set aside to cool slightly. In a large bowl, whisk together the gruyere, cream, Parmesan, lemon zest, eggs and the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt.Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the pasta and cook until just tender but still firm to the bite, stirring occasionally, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain, reserving 1 cup of the pasta water. Add the pasta back to the pan along with the onions, cream mixture, 1/4 cup of the reserved pasta water and the pancetta. Toss over low heat until the sauce is thick and coats the pasta, adding pasta water as needed, about 2 minutes (do not boil).Season the pasta with lots of pepper. Transfer the pasta to a large, wide serving bowl. Sprinkle with chives and serve.                                                            Food Network Kitchens suggest caution in consuming raw and lightly cooked eggs due to the risk of Salmonella or other food-borne illness. To reduce this risk, we recommend you use only fresh, properly refrigerated, clean, grade A or AA eggs with intact shells and avoid contact between the yolks or whites and the shell. For recipes that call for eggs that are raw or undercooked when the dish is served, use shell eggs that have been treated to destroy Salmonella, by pasteurization or another approved method.

The cookies will firm up when they cool, and are much better if they are NOT over-cooked!"},{"vegetarian":true,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":true,"dairyFree":false,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":true,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":13,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":false,"servings":12,"preparationMinutes":275,"cookingMinutes":0,"sourceUrl":"http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchens/avocado-ice-cream.html","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/avocado-ice-cream-733270","aggregateLikes":1442,"creditText":"Foodnetwork","sourceName":"Foodnetwork","extendedIngredients":[{"id":9037,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/avocado.jpg","name":"avocado","amount":8,"unit":"ounce","unitShort":"oz","unitLong":"ounces","originalString":"1 8-ounce avocado, halved, pitted and peeled","metaInformation":["pitted","peeled","halved"]},{"id":1053,"aisle":"Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/fluid-cream.jpg","name":"heavy cream","amount":2,"unit":"cups","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"2 cups cold heavy cream","metaInformation":["cold"]},{"id":9152,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/lemon-juice.jpg","name":"lemon juice","amount":2,"unit":"tablespoons","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoons","originalString":"2 tablespoons lemon juice (from 1 lemon)","metaInformation":["(from 1 lemon)"]},{"id":2047,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg","name":"salt","amount":1,"unit":"pinch","unitShort":"pinch","unitLong":"pinch","originalString":"Pinch fine salt","metaInformation":["fine"]},{"id":1095,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/evaporated-milk.jpg","name":"sweetened condensed milk","amount":14,"unit":"ounce","unitShort":"oz","unitLong":"ounces","originalString":"1 14-ounce can sweetened condensed milk","metaInformation":["sweetened","canned"]}],"id":733270,"title":"Avocado Ice Cream","readyInMinutes":275,"image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/avocado-ice-cream-733270.jpeg","imageType":"jpeg","cuisines":[],"instructions":"Directions                                                        Special equipment: a 9-by-5-by-3-inch metal loaf panChill the loaf pan in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.Puree the avocado, milk, lemon juice and salt in a blender until smooth, about 1 minute; transfer to a large bowl.Whip the cream in another large bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until firm peaks form, about 2 minutes.

Add the batter into the prepared loaf pan and bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean (about 50-55 minutes).While the cake bakes, make the Meyer lemon simple syrup by mixing the sugar and lemon juice in a small nonreactive saucepan and heat while stirring until the sugar dissolves. When the cake is done, slowly pour or spoon the syrup over the cake while it is still hot. Make sure you let each addition of syrup soak in before adding more. Let the cake cool for 10 minutes and then turn it out onto a wire rack to cool completely. For the glaze, whisk the powdered sugar together with 2 teaspoons of lemon juice until there are no lumps. The glaze should be thin enough to pour, but thick enough that it's not runny. Adjust the viscosity with more powdered sugar or lemon juice. Drizzle this over the cooled cake, allowing it to run down the sides. Let the glaze set before slicing and

using a paring knife, detach stem ends without cutting into flesh. Score bottom end of each tomato with shallow “x,” and set aside. Prepare large bowl of ice water, and set aside. In 5-quart saucepan or Dutch oven, bring 3 quarts water to a rolling boil. Drop tomatoes into boiling water for 30 seconds, or until skins begin to peel. Remove tomatoes immediately with slotted spoon, and immerse in ice bath. Let tomatoes sit for 5 minutes. The tomatoes should still be firm with slightly wrinkled skin beginning to separate, making skin slip off easily. Place tomatoes in food processor, and pulse to chop. Set aside. Heat oil and crushed red pepper in 5-quart saucepan over medium-high heat,1 minute. Add garlic and onion, and sauté 3 minutes. Add carrots and zucchini, and cook 5 minutes, or until vegetables soften. Add tomatoes, and spoon in tomato paste. Reduce heat to medium-low, fill paste can with Merlot and pour into saucepan.

Stir until smooth. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until thickened.Pour half of the flour mixture into the beaten egg yolks, beating to incorporate. Pour the egg yolk mixture into the pan, mix, and continue cooking for about 10 minutes, stirring and scraping the bottom constantly, until the mixture is thick and coats the back of a spoon.You now have your custard filling. But you have to cool the filling completely before using it. Otherwise, it will create steam and make the pastry shells soggy. So, give the filling an hour or so to cool.Remember to cool the pastry shells too.When both filling and shells have cooled, it’s time to assemble. If you have a pastry bag, fit it with a large tip. Spoon the filling into the bag, poke a hole at the side of a pastry shell and pipe in the filling.If you don’t have a pastry bag, you can split the pastry shells into halves. Spoon the filling on the bottom half then cover with the top half.Then, you garnish your cream puffs. This is an optional stage since the cream puffs are complete after the pastry shells have been filled. But, if you want those little extras…Probably the most common topping is caramelized sugar (see how to caramelize sugar). Just drizzle the caramelized sugar over the cream puffs and your’re done.Or, just sprinkle the cream puffs with powdered sugar.Another option is to melt some chocolate then dip the tops of the cream puffs in it.Which option is best? You decide. Be creative. Those three aren’t the only options, in fact. You can make a sugar glaze, spread it on the cream puffs then decorate with colorful sprinkles — the last option will be especially attractive on the Christmas buffet table."},{"vegetarian":false,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":false,"dairyFree":false,"veryHealthy":true,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":false,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":105,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":false,"servings":6,"preparationMinutes":30,"cookingMinutes":310,"sourceUrl":"http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Roast-Goose-with-Stuffing/","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/roast-goose-with-stuffing-451660","aggregateLikes":27,"creditText":"Allrecipes","sourceName":"Allrecipes","extendedIngredients":[{"id":9003,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/apple.jpg","name":"apples","amount":4,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"4

It might come off a little on your fingers, but thats okay. Cooling will take at least 2 hours. You can make the cake a day ahead. Just wrap the cooled cake with plastic wrap overnight.Make the filling: Beat cold heavy whipping cream in a stand mixer with the whisk attachment (or in a large bowl with a hand mixer) until soft peaks form. (This takes about 2 minutes with my stand mixer on medium speed.) Add powdered sugar, vanilla, and eggnog. Continue beating until stiff peaks form. Be careful not to overwhip.Once cake is cool, carefully unroll it. It might leave a little mess on the towel, but thats okay, as long as you can peel it off. Spread about half the whipped cream over the top of the cake, leaving an edge at the end. Starting at the narrow end, re-roll the cake. As you roll it the filling will shift a little and you may need to remove some if youve put too much on the cake. Thats okay, just have a knife handy to scrape off any excess as you roll. At this point you can wrap the cake in plastic wrap and refrigerate for up to 24 hours.

non-stick skillet heat soy sauce and butter until the butter is melted. Add chopped mushrooms and cook for about 5 to 7 minutes stirring frequently. Remove from pan and allow to cool on a paper towel-lined plate.Prep vegetables and garlic and add to a large mixing bowl. Add sesame oil, vinegar and salt and pepper. Mix thoroughly with a large spoon. Smash the shrimp with the side your knife and chop. Add to the cabbage mixture and combine.Set up a small bowl of water and wnwrap dumpling wrappers (leaving them in the wrapper but also covering with a wet paper towel to insure they don't dry up) and one at a time, scoop about a teaspoon of filing into the middle of your wrapper. Dab a small spot of water onto the middle top of your dumpling, fold in half and press to seal. Using your thumb and finger, fold pleats into the dumpling on one side and then do the same for the other side. For reference, check out my video on how to wrap potstickers.Repeat until you have no more dumpling wrappers or no more filling.How to Cook the PotstickersI usually make about 8 to 10 at a time to not crowd the pan. Add 1/2 Tablespoon oil to a non-stick skillet and turn heat to medium. Add dumplings to the skillet and cover. Cook for about 2 to 3 minutes. If frozen, add an extra minute. Uncover and add 1/4 cup of water (1/3 cup if frozen) and recover and allow potstickers to steam for about 3 to 4 minutes (4 to 6 minutes if frozen).Serve with soy sauce.Notes:These potstickers definitely freezer friendly. Place uncooked dumplings onto a plate or a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper and freeze for at least 2 hours. Once frozen, they can go into a freezer friendly container or zippered plastic bag."},{"vegetarian":true,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":false,"dairyFree":false,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":true,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":14,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":false,"servings":12,"preparationMinutes":20,"cookingMinutes":15,"sourceUrl":"http://www.sumptuousspoonfuls.com/apple-cinnamon-scones-with-maple-drizzle/","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/apple-cinnamon-scones-with-maple-cream-cheese-drizzle-552938","aggregateLikes":638,"creditText":"Sumptuous Spoonfuls","sourceName":"Sumptuous Spoonfuls","extendedIngredients":[{"id":9003,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/apple.jpg","name":"apples","amount":2,"unit":"cups","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"2 cups peeled, chopped apples","metaInformation":["peeled","chopped"]},{"id":18371,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg","name":"baking powder","amount":3,"unit":"teaspoons","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"3 teaspoons baking powder","metaInformation":[]},{"id":18372,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg","name":"baking soda","amount":0.5,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"1/2 teaspoon baking soda","metaInformation":[]},{"id":1001,"aisle":"Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg","name":"butter","amount":6,"unit":"tablespoons","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoons","originalString":"6 tablespoons chilled butter, cut into little pieces","metaInformation":["chilled","cut into little pieces"]},{"id":2010,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cinnamon.jpg","name":"cinnamon","amount":1,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoon","originalString":"1 teaspoon cinnamon","metaInformation":[]},{"id":10019335,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg","name":"coarse sugar","amount":2,"unit":"tablespoons","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoons","originalString":"2 tablespoons coarse sugar","metaInformation":[]},{"id":1123,"aisle":"Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg","name":"egg","amount":1,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"1 egg","metaInformation":[]},{"id":20081,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png","name":"flour","amount":1,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cup","originalString":"1 cup all-purpose flour","metaInformation":["all-purpose"]},{"id":19335,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg","name":"granulated sugar","amount":0.25,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"1/4 cup granulated sugar","metaInformation":[]},{"id":1256,"aisle":"Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-cream.jpg","name":"greek yogurt","amount":1,"unit":"oz","unitShort":"oz","unitLong":"ounce","originalString":"1 oz.

(I use my fingersits messy, but fun!) Toss the apples in the flour mixture until they are fully coated.In a separate bowl combine the egg, yogurt and vanilla and whisk until smooth.Stir the egg mixture into the flour mixture and mix until just blended (dough will be soft and wet).Directly in the bowl, knead the dough lightly 3-4 times.

Watch how to make this recipe.                                                        For the casserole: Preheat the oven to 375degrees F. Butter a 13- by 9-inch ovenproof dish or lasagna dish and set aside.Cook the egg noodles in salted boiling water according to package directions for al dente, about 8 minutes. Drain and immediately place the noodles in a large bowl filled with ice water to stop the cooking. Once cooled, drain and then pour the pasta into a large bowl with the tuna, peas and both cheeses. Toss to combine.In a large pan with straight sides, add the 2 tablespoons butter, the olive oil, onions and thyme. Season with a sprinkle of salt and pepper and cook on medium heat until the onions are tender and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the mushrooms, season with salt and cook gently until tender and darkened, about 5 minutes more. Add the Worcestershire sauce and horseradish, and then sprinkle the flour over the entire pan. Stir to help the flour soak into the vegetables and cook a minute more to lose the flour taste. Raise the heat to medium-high and add the chicken stock. Cook until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes, and then slowly stir in the heavy cream. Simmer until the cream is thickened slightly, about 4 minutes more. Taste and season with salt if needed. Pour the mushroom sauce over the prepared noodles in the large bowl and quickly stir to combine. Immediately pour into the prepared dish.For the topping: In a small bowl, combine the breadcrumbs and olive oil. Season with a sprinkle of salt and a grind or two of pepper. Stir until the crumbs soak up the oil evenly. Sprinkle the breadcrumb mixture evenly over the top of the dish and place, uncovered, in the oven until the sides are bubbly and the top is golden brown, about 35 minutes. Let it rest 5 minutes before serving.

Spoon the berries into a bowl and continue simmering the wine until it has reduced by half. Let it cool a little and then remove the cinnamon stick and pour the berries back in.2. While the berries are simmering away, start on the rice pudding. Pour the rice into a large pan, along with the milk and sugar. Bring to the boil, then turn the heat down low and cook until the rice is creamy and tender. This should take about 10-15 minutes. Make sure you stir it regularly, so it doesn't stick.

sucrée1. In a bowl, whisk the flour to aerate it.2. In the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter, sugar, and salt on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes, scraping down the sides of the bowl halfway through. Add the egg and yolk and mix to combine. Add the flour and beat until it has been absorbed.3. Scoop about half of the dough onto a sheet of plastic wrap, shape into a flattened disk, and wrap tightly. Repeat with the remaining dough. Refrigerate until firm, at least 2 hours. This makes enough for 1 double-crust or 2 single-crust 9-inch pies.Make the tartlets4. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a nonstick silicone baking mat. Butter sixteen 2-inch tart molds (or muffin tins).5. On a lightly floured work surface, roll the dough to about 1/8 inch thick. Cut as many 2 1/2-inch rounds as possible and fit them into the prepared molds. Chill and re-roll the scraps. Cut out the remaining number of rounds and fit them into the remaining molds. You should be able to line 16 tartlet molds. Arrange the molds on the prepared baking sheet and refrigerate for 20 minutes.6. To make the streusel, in a medium bowl, use a fork to stir together the flour, brown sugar, salt, and cinnamon. Add the butter, and using your fingertips, quickly work it into the dry ingredients until pea-size crumbs form. Cover and refrigerate.7. Set the oven rack in the bottom third of the oven. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C).8. Spoon about 1 teaspoon jam into each tart shell. Mound 1 rounded tablespoon of streusel on top of each tartlet, scrunching the crumbs together in order to make large crumbs which will give the topping texture.9. Bake, rotating the baking sheet after about 12 minutes, until the edges of the tarts are golden brown and the streusel is cooked, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool on a wire rack."},{"vegetarian":false,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":true,"dairyFree":true,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":false,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":32,"gaps":"GAPS_3","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":false,"servings":4,"sourceUrl":"http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2011/02/roast-duck-with-honey-ginger-glaze.html","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/sunday-supper-roast-duck-with-honey-ginger-glaze-207291","aggregateLikes":52,"creditText":"Serious Eats","sourceName":"Serious Eats","extendedIngredients":[{"id":2030,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pepper.jpg","name":"cracked pepper","amount":4,"unit":"servings","unitShort":"servings","unitLong":"servings","originalString":"Cracked black pepper","metaInformation":["black"]},{"id":19296,"aisle":"Nut butters, Jams, and Honey","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/honey.jpg","name":"honey","amount":0.25,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"1/4 cup honey","metaInformation":[]},{"id":1082047,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg","name":"kosher salt","amount":4,"unit":"servings","unitShort":"servings","unitLong":"servings","originalString":"Kosher salt","metaInformation":[]},{"id":5139,"aisle":"Meat","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/duck-raw.jpg","name":"whole duck","amount":1,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"1 whole duck, 4 to 5 pounds","metaInformation":["whole"]}],"id":207291,"title":"Sunday Supper: Roast Duck with Honey Ginger Glaze","readyInMinutes":225,"image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Sunday-Supper--Roast-Duck-with-Honey-Ginger-Glaze-207291.jpg","imageType":"jpg","cuisines":[],"instructions":"Procedures                                                                              1                                                                            Preheat oven to 300°F.
