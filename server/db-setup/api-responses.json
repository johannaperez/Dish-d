Cupcakes","readyInMinutes":140,"image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/strawberry-butterfly-cupcakes-672230.jpg","imageType":"jpg","cuisines":["american"],"instructions":"In a medium mixing bowl, combine flour, baking powder, and salt; sift or whisk together to mix. Set aside.In a small mixing bowl, stir the milk and vanilla together. Set aside.In a large bowl of an electric mixer, cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Tip: To cream, start by placing the butter in the bowl, with an electric mixer on medium speed begin by beating the butter about 1 minute until it is smooth and light in color. With the mixer still on medium speed, slowly add the sugar to the butter, either one tablespoon at a time, or in a very slow steady stream, taking from 4 to 8 minutes to add all of the sugar, and beating until the butter and sugar are fully incorporated and the mixture is a light, or pale yellow color, with a fluffy texture. While adding the sugar, stop the mixer occasionally to scrape the mixture off the paddle and scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula so the mixture blends evenly.Add eggs one at a time, beating until thoroughly mixed. Tip: For each egg, crack the egg into a small bowl and whisk with a fork to thoroughly break up the egg before adding to the creamed mixture. Start with the mixer on low speed so the liquid from the egg doesnt splatter, once the egg is partially mixed increase the speed to medium. Each egg should be fully incorporated into the mixture before adding the next egg, taking about one minute to blend in each egg.With the mixer on low speed, add about one third of the flour mixture, mix just until the flour is almost completely blended. Scrape the bowl down, and add about one half of the milk mixture, blending just until mixed. Scrape the bowl down again and continue alternating with the flour mixture and milk mixture, ending with the last portion of the flour, and stirring just until blended.Spoon the batter into the cupcake liners. Fill  full, using about  cup of batter per cup. Tip: Avoid over-filling the liners which may cause the batter to run-over the sides when baking. It is better to bake any remaining batter separately after the first pan of cupcakes has finished baking.Bake: Bake, rotating pan halfway through, 18 to 20 minutes, or until the cakes are just firm and spring back when gently pressed, and a toothpick, wooden skewer, or cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool slightly in cupcake pan, and turn out of pan when cool enough to handle. Repeat process with any remaining batter. Cool cupcakes completely on a wire cooling rack before frosting and decorating.When cupcakes are cooled, cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before cutting out the wings to reduce crumbs.In a large bowl of an electric stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment combine eggs and egg yolks. Whisk on medium high speed for 5 to 8 minutes until the eggs become thick and lemon colored and drop in ribbons when the beater is lifted. Tip: continue beating the eggs until the sugar syrup is cooked.Meanwhile, in a medium size heavy saucepan, preferably non-stick, combine sugar and water. Heat over medium heat, stirring constantly with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon, until the sugar is completely dissolved. Stir gently to avoid splashing the mixture onto the sides of the pan.When the syrup looks clear increase the heat to medium high and bring to a boil, without stirring, until the syrup reaches a temperature of 238 degrees F, a soft-ball stage, using a candy or instant read thermometer to gauge the temperature. While the syrup is cooking, wash away any sugar crystals that form on the sides of the pan by wiping upwards with a damp pastry brush so the sugar crystals dont fall back into the syrup. Immediately remove pan from the heat. Optional: As soon as the syrup reaches 238 degrees F. immediately remove from the heat and pour the syrup into a glass measuring cup to stop the cooking. Be careful, the sugar is extremely hot and will burn your skin if you touch it.Quickly, as soon at the sugar syrup is done cooking, stop the mixer, pour a small amount of syrup into the beaten egg yolks, immediately turn the mixer on to high speed and beat for 5 to 10 seconds still using the whisk attachment. Turn the mixer off again, pour a little larger amount of syrup in the eggs, and immediately turn the mixer on to high speed for 5 to 10 seconds. Continue with the remaining syrup. Tip: You want to work quickly as the sugar starts to harden and thicken pretty quickly. Dont allow any syrup to pour onto the whisk as it will spin the syrup around the sides of the bowl.Once all the sugar has been added to the eggs, continue beating the mixture at high speed, about 5 minutes longer, or until the mixture is cool. Tip: Touch the mixture and make sure it has cooled to room temperature. Also the outside of the bowl should feel cool to the touch.Stop the mixer, remove the whisk and attach the paddle. With the mixer on medium speed add the butter, about 2 tablespoons at a time and mixing 20 to 30 seconds after each addition. While adding the butter, stop the mixer occasionally to scrape the mixture off the paddle and scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula so the mixture blends evenly. The Buttercream may look curdled after the butter is added, but it will become smooth as you continue to beat it. Add the vanilla and continue beating until the Buttercream is thick and smooth, about another 2 to 3 minutes.Buttercream should be used immediately, or refrigerate until ready to use. Use a pastry bag and large star decorating tip to pipe the frosting.Using a small sharp kitchen knife, hold the knife at a 45 degree angle, and cut out a cone-shaped piece from the top of each chilled cupcake, cutting about  inch from the outside edge. Cut the cone in half down the middle to make the butterfly wings.Place about 1 teaspoon of strawberry preserves into the hole made from the cone-shaped cutout. Pipe a large rosette of Buttercream over the jam, filling in the hole and piping the rosette at least one inch above the cupcake.Arrange the 2 cut halves on top of the frosting rosette to form the wings, and place a strawberry half between the wings. Use a fine-mesh sieve to dust the top of the strawberry and wings with confectioners sugar.Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve."},{"vegetarian":true,"vegan":true,"glutenFree":true,"dairyFree":true,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":true,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":11,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":true,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":false,"servings":10,"preparationMinutes":25,"cookingMinutes":50,"sourceUrl":"http://www.theroastedroot.net/blueberry-oatmeal-breakfast-cake-coconut-drizzle/","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/blueberry-oatmeal-breakfast-cake-with-coconut-drizzle-512676","aggregateLikes":805,"creditText":"The Roasted Root","sourceName":"The Roasted Root","extendedIngredients":[{"id":18371,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg","name":"baking powder","amount":2,"unit":"teaspoons","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"2 teaspoons baking powder","metaInformation":[]},{"id":9050,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/blueberries.jpg","name":"blueberries","amount":2,"unit":"cups","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"2 cups fresh blueberries","metaInformation":["fresh"]},{"id":12117,"aisle":"Canned and Jarred","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/coconut-milk.jpg","name":"canned coconut milk","amount":14,"unit":"ounce","unitShort":"oz","unitLong":"ounces","originalString":"1 14-ounce can coconut milk","metaInformation":["canned"]},{"id":4047,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/oil-coconut.jpg","name":"coconut oil","amount":1,"unit":"tablespoon","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoon","originalString":"1 heaping tablespoon coconut oil**","metaInformation":[]},{"id":93831,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/palm-sugar.jpg","name":"coconut sugar","amount":0.6666666666666666,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"2/3 cup coconut sugar*","metaInformation":[]},{"id":12220,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flax-seeds.jpg","name":"flax meal","amount":2,"unit":"tablespoons","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoons","originalString":"2 tablespoons flax meal","metaInformation":[]},{"id":2010,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cinnamon.jpg","name":"ground cinnamon","amount":0.5,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"½ teaspoon ground cinnamon","metaInformation":[]},{"id":19911,"aisle":"Cereal","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/maple-syrup-or-agave-nectar.jpg","name":"maple syrup","amount":3,"unit":"tablespoons","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoons","originalString":"3 tablespoons pure maple syrup","metaInformation":["pure"]},{"id":20132,"aisle":"Health Foods","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-flour.jpg","name":"oat flour","amount":1,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cup","originalString":"1 cup Bob's Red Mill oat flour","metaInformation":["red"]},{"id":2047,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg","name":"salt","amount":0.25,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"¼ teaspoon salt","metaInformation":[]},{"id":93695,"aisle":"Cereal","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/steel-cut-oats.png","name":"steel cut oats","amount":1,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cup","originalString":"1 cup Bob's Red Mill steel cut oats","metaInformation":["red"]},{"id":2050,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla-extract.jpg","name":"vanilla extract","amount":1,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoon","originalString":"1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract","metaInformation":["pure"]},{"id":14412,"aisle":"Beverages","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/water.jpg","name":"water","amount":2,"unit":"cups","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"2-1/2 cups water","metaInformation":[]},{"id":14412,"aisle":"Beverages","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/water.jpg","name":"water","amount":6,"unit":"tablespoons","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoons","originalString":"6 tablespoons water","metaInformation":[]}],"id":512676,"title":"Blueberry Oatmeal Breakfast Cake with Coconut Drizzle","readyInMinutes":85,"image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Blueberry-Oatmeal-Breakfast-Cake-with-Coconut-Drizzle-512676.jpg","imageType":"jpg","cuisines":[],"instructions":"Soak the steel cut oats in 2-1/2 cups of water for 3 to 4 hours. Transfer the oats AND all of the water to a medium-sized saucepan and bring it to a boil. Cook for 15 minutes (or until thick and most of the water has been absorbed), stirring occasionally. Remove from heat, stir in the vanilla extract, and allow the oatmeal to cool slightly.In a small mixing bowl, combine the ground flax meal and the 6 tablespoons of water. This creates a vegan flax egg. Allow the mixture to sit 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.In a mixing bowl, stir together the oat flour, coconut sugar, cinnamon, baking powder, and salt.Toss blueberries in 2 tablespoons flour then combine with the rest of the flour mixture. Pour the blueberry/flour mixture into the pot with the cooked steel cut oatmeal and stir to combine. Add the flax eggs and stir until everything is well combined.Add the heaping tablespoon of coconut oil to the cast iron skillet and heat to medium. Spread the oil around and make sure the whole skillet (including the sides) gets coated with oil.Pour the cake mixture into the cast iron skillet and spread it evenly.Place a cover over the skillet (I used a large baking sheet) and cook for 12 minutes.Remove the over and cook an additional 30 to 35 minutes, or until cake turns uniform in color.Note: the sides and bottom of the cake will firm up before the center. Continue cooking until the center is firm and not sticky.  Also note that I cook at high elevation, so play close attention to the cake, as your cook time could be different from (less than) mine. Another note: The blueberries will begin to juice out and will begin to caramelize against the cast iron. It will smell like somethings burning, but fret not. Its just the blueberries and all will be fine. Unless of course your cake really is burning, in which case: take it off the stove.Allow cake to sit at least 30 minutes before turning it over onto a cutting board. Pour the coconut drizzle (see instructions below) over the cake and serve.While the cake is cooking (or cooling), add the can of coconut milk and maple syrup to a small pot. Bring it to a full boil, then reduce the heat and cook at a gentle boil for 35 to 45 minutes, stirring frequently.  The coconut milk should be thick. Pour it into a measuring cup until ready to use."},{"vegetarian":false,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":true,"dairyFree":true,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":false,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":1,"gaps":"GAPS_5","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":true,"servings":10,"preparationMinutes":5,"cookingMinutes":120,"sourceUrl":"http://www.insockmonkeyslippers.com/homemade-turkey-stock-using-leftovers","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/homemade-turkey-stock-from-leftovers-480990","aggregateLikes":111,"creditText":"In Sock Monkey Slippers","sourceName":"In Sock Monkey Slippers","extendedIngredients":[{"id":2004,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/bay-leaves.jpg","name":"bay leaf","amount":1,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"1 bay leaf","metaInformation":[]},{"id":2030,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pepper.jpg","name":"black peppercorns","amount":0.5,"unit":"tablespoon","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoons","originalString":"1/2 tablespoon black peppercorns","metaInformation":["black"]},{"id":11124,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/carrots.jpg","name":"carrots","amount":2,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"2 carrots, cut in half","metaInformation":["cut in half"]},{"id":11143,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/celery.jpg","name":"celery stalks","amount":2,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"2 celery stalks","metaInformation":[]},{"id":11215,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg","name":"garlic","amount":1,"unit":"head","unitShort":"head","unitLong":"head","originalString":"1 head of garlic, sliced in half","metaInformation":["sliced in half"]},{"id":1002044,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/mixed-fresh-herbs.jpg","name":"herbs","amount":1,"unit":"bunch","unitShort":"bunch","unitLong":"bunch","originalString":"1 small bunch of fresh herbs; parsley, thyme, and sage","metaInformation":["fresh","small"]},{"id":1082047,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg","name":"kosher salt","amount":0.5,"unit":"tablespoon","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoons","originalString":"1/2 tablespoon kosher salt","metaInformation":[]},{"id":11282,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-onion.jpg","name":"onion","amount":1,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"1 onion, quartered","metaInformation":["quartered"]},{"id":5165,"aisle":"Meat","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/turkey-raw-whole.jpg","name":"turkey","amount":10,"unit":"servings","unitShort":"servings","unitLong":"servings","originalString":"Bones from a roasted turkey","metaInformation":[]}],"id":480990,"title":"Homemade Turkey Stock From Leftovers","readyInMinutes":125,"image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Homemade-Turkey-Stock-From-Leftovers-480990.jpg","imageType":"jpg","cuisines":[],"instructions":"Place all ingredients in a large stock pot.

Heat over medium heat until it just begins to boil and the craisins are plump. Quickly drain the craisins and place in a bowl in the fridge to cool.In the bowl of a KitchenAid, add the butter and shortening and mix to combine until smooth. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and add the brown and white sugar. Turn the mixer onto low for a few seconds and then increase to medium speed and beat for 1-2 minutes.Scrape down the sides of the bowl again and add the egg and vanilla. Beat until well incorporated.In a small bowl, gently stir together the flour, oats, cinnamon, salt and baking soda. Add to the wet ingredients and beat for about 30 seconds.Remove the craisins from the fridge and blot dry with paper towels. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and add the craisins, chocolate chips and toffee, mixing until just combined. Scrape the sides down one last time and tightly cover the bowl with saran wrap. Place in the fridge for 1-2 hours.Remove the bowl from the fridge and heat the oven to 350 degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment or a silpat. Scoop out rounded tablespoons of the dough, or we prefer to use a cookie scoop, onto the baking sheet and bake for 8-9 minutes.

In a medium mixing bowl, beat the eggs with milk, 1/4 tsp pepper and 1/2 tsp salt till fluffy (if salt sensitive use 1/4 tsp salt). Reserve.Harissas vary in thickness/pastiness. If your harissa is a thicker, drier paste, stir in a little olive oil till it becomes more liquid and easier to spread. Reserve.Heat olive oil in skillet on medium high till hot but not smoking. Add the sliced mushrooms in a single layer. Let them sear for 3-4 minutes without stirring till golden on the bottom. Stir the mushrooms, then stir in 1-2 tbsp of harissa to taste. I used about 1 1/2 tbsp-- you may need more or less depending on the spiciness of your harissa. The mushrooms should be spicy and well seasoned, but not too spicy to handle. Stir till the mushrooms are golden brown and coated with harissa.Stir in minced garlic and chopped parsley (reserve 2 tsp parsley for garnish). Saute for 1-2 minutes till the garlic is fragrant. Spread the mushrooms and herbs out in a single, even layer.Sprinkle the goat cheese evenly across the top of the mushroom and parsley layer.Rewhisk the eggs till fluffy, then pour them evenly over the top of the other ingredients, tilting the pan in each direction to make sure all ingredients are evenly covered with egg. Cook for 2 minutes till the edges begin to solidify and brown a bit. Sprinkle the paprika lightly across the top of the eggs.Place the fritatta carefully in the oven. Let it bake for about 10 minutes, till a knife inserted in the center comes out clean. Remove from oven and allow to cool for a few minutes. It will be puffy when you first take it out of the oven, then it will settle.Slice the fritatta and serve. I plated this with some organic mache greens. It goes great with a light spring salad or Israeli salad on the side, and a slice of whole grain toast if you're not gluten intolerant."},{"vegetarian":false,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":false,"dairyFree":false,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":false,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":7,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":false,"servings":8,"sourceUrl":"http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2012/12/glazed-cocktail-sausage-crescent-roll-sandwich.html","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/glazed-cocktail-sausage-and-crescent-roll-sandwiches-204038","aggregateLikes":72,"creditText":"Serious Eats","sourceName":"Serious Eats","extendedIngredients":[{"id":2048,"aisle":"Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/apple-cider-vinegar.jpg","name":"apple cider vinegar","amount":2,"unit":"teaspoons","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar","metaInformation":[]},{"id":1002030,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pepper.jpg","name":"black pepper","amount":8,"unit":"servings","unitShort":"servings","unitLong":"servings","originalString":"Freshly ground black pepper","metaInformation":["black","freshly ground"]},{"id":2031,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chili-powder.jpg","name":"cayenne pepper","amount":1,"unit":"pinch","unitShort":"pinch","unitLong":"pinch","originalString":"Pinch cayenne pepper","metaInformation":[]},{"id":7235,"aisle":"Meat","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cocktail-sausages.png","name":"cocktail sausages","amount":16,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"16 cocktail sausages, such as Hillshire Farm Lil' Smokies","metaInformation":[" such as hillshire farm lil' smokies"]},{"id":93618,"aisle":"Refrigerated","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/crescent-rolls.jpg","name":"crescent rolls","amount":1,"unit":"can","unitShort":"can","unitLong":"can","originalString":"1 (8-count) can crescent rolls, such as Pillsbury","metaInformation":[" such as pillsbury","(8-count)"]},{"id":10519297,"aisle":"Nut butters, Jams, and Honey","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/grape-jelly.jpg","name":"grape jelly","amount":3,"unit":"tablespoons","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoons","originalString":"3 tablespoons guava or grape jelly","metaInformation":[]},{"id":11935,"aisle":"Condiments","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ketchup.jpg","name":"ketchup","amount":3,"unit":"tablespoons","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoons","originalString":"3 tablespoons ketchup","metaInformation":[]},{"id":2046,"aisle":"Condiments","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/mustard.jpg","name":"spicy brown mustard","amount":2,"unit":"teaspoons","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"2 teaspoons spicy mustard, plus additional for serving","metaInformation":["for serving"]},{"id":1145,"aisle":"Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg","name":"unsalted butter","amount":1,"unit":"tablespoon","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoon","originalString":"1 tablespoon unsalted butter","metaInformation":["unsalted"]}],"id":204038,"title":"Glazed Cocktail Sausage and Crescent Roll Sandwiches","readyInMinutes":20,"image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Glazed-Cocktail-Sausage-and-Crescent-Roll-Sandwiches-204038.jpg","imageType":"jpg","cuisines":[],"instructions":"Procedures                                                                              1                                                                            Bake crescent rolls according to package directions.                                                                                                                            2                                                                            Meanwhile, in small bowl whisk together jelly, ketchup, 2 teaspoons mustard, vinegar, pepper, and cayenne.

As mango begins to break down, press down on it with a fork or potato masher, to mash it. Continue cooking until mango cooks down to form a chunky puree, about 15 minutes. Remove half to serve as a sauce. Set the other half aside for dredging.On a large plate, mix together flour, cornmeal, sugar and salt.Preheat a large skillet. Season salmon with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Brush glaze over top of salmon, then dredge in cornmeal mixture. Add oil and butter to skillet. Over high heat, sear salmon cornmeal mixture face down until golden, about 6 to 8 minutes for medium rare, flipping halfway through to crisp skin.

Stir in cherries, raisins and pecans.                                                                                            Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place for 1 hour (dough will not double in size).                                                                                           Punch dough down; divide into four pieces. Roll three pieces into 15-in. ropes. Braid ropes; place on a greased baking sheet. Divide last portion of dough in half; roll each into a 15-in. rope. Twist ropes. Press an indentation down the center of braided loaf; place twisted dough in indentation. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 30 minutes.                                                                                            Beat egg yolk and water; brush over loaf. Bake at 350° for 20 minutes. Cover loosely with foil; bake 20-25 minutes more. Cool on a wire rack. Combine sugar and milk; drizzle over loaf. Decorate with cherries if desired.                                        Yield: 1 loaf.

oven to 450F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.Make the Creamy Green Chili Sauce: Remove the husks from the tomatillos and rinse under cool water to remove the stickiness. Place the tomatillos, onion and green chiles on the baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil. Add a generous pinch of salt and toss. Place the wrapped garlic on the pan. Roast for 15 minutes or until the tomatillos are soft and the skin of the green chiles has lightly blackened. (Alternatively, you can char the vegetables on the grill.) Remove from the oven and let cool slightly. Once the green chiles are cool to the touch, remove the stems, ribbing and any loose skin. Peel the garlic.In a food processor, combine the cooked tomatillos, onion, green chiles, garlic, and a few generous pinches of salt and pepper. Pulse, then add the pepitas, avocado, spinach and lime juice. Blend until smooth and taste. If its too tart, add a drizzle of olive oil and honey. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Chill until ready to use.Place the corn tortillas on a baking sheet and spray each with a little olive oil and sprinkle with a few pinches of salt. Bake until crispy, 10 to 15 minutes, depending on the thickness of the tortillas.Place the refried beans in a small bowl. If theyre not already seasoned, add a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and stir.Assemble the tostadas with the refried beans, peaches, tomatoes, and generous dollops of the Creamy Green Chile Sauce. Sprinkle with the pepitas and cotija cheese, if using.

Quickly stir in the marshmallows and cook until completely melted. Add the chopped strawberries, combine with the mixture and remove from the heat. Stir in the cereal until well-coated and combined.

cups of water to a boil.  Place chilis in a heat-proof bowl.  Cover with boiling water, set a plate on top of the bowl and set aside.Heat olive oil in a large, steep sided skillet over medium heat.  Add onions and cook until soft, 8 to 10 minutes.  Add garlic and cook for another minute.  Stir in chicken stock, water, tomatoes, tomato paste, cumin, oregano, cinnamon, and chilis.  Discard chili soaking water.Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer.  Cook for 15 minutes, or until sauce has slightly thickened.  Taste and add salt if necessary.  If sauce is spicy enough, remove chilis.Place sauce in your VitaMix or blender.  Remove the plug in the top of the blender and cover with a kitchen towel.  This allows steam to escape and will save your blender from blowing it’s top.  Start on low and increase to medium high, pureeing until smooth.  Return to sauce pan and keep warm.Preheat oven to 350F.  Use one 9×13 baking dish or two smaller 8×8 baking dishes.  Wrap 12 corn tortillas in aluminum foil and heat in oven for 10 minutes.  Increase heat to 450F when you remove tortillas.Heat olive oil over medium heat.  Add onions and cook until translucent, 5 – 8 minutes.  Add garlic and cook for another minute, until fragrant.  Add mushrooms and cook until soft.  Move onion mixture to the side of the skillet and brown ground turkey, stirring onion mixture in as turkey cooks. Season to taste with salt and pepper.Set up an assembly line of sorts with your warm tortillas, shredded cheese, turkey & mushroom mixture, and dishes.  Cover the bottom the baking dish with sauce. Put a tablespoon or so of cheese down the middle of the tortilla then fill with a generous 1/4 cup of turkey.  Fold the sides in and place seam side down in the baking dish.  Repeat with remaining tortillas.  Cover with enchilada sauce, top with remaining cheese, and bake for 15 – 20 minutes, until bubbly and cheese is lightly browned.

the oven to 350 degrees F. Line 12 standard muffin cups with paper liners.In a small bowl, stir together the graham-style crumbs, 2 Tbsp sugar and melted butter. Place about 1 Tablespoon into each of the 12 muffin cups. With your fingers, pat it down to cover the bottom of the cup (you should have a little bit leftover to sprinkle on top fo the cupcakes). Sprinkle about 1 teaspoon of the mini chocolate chips over the cookie crust. Bake in the preheated oven for about 5 minutes, or until lightly browned around the edges. Remove from oven while you prepare the cupcake batter.In a large mixing bowl, stir together the brown rice flour, tapioca starch, millet (or sorghum) flour, xanthan gum, sugar, cocoa powder, espresso powder, baking powder and baking soda until well blended. Set aside.In a smaller mixing bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, oil, vanilla and eggs.Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients, and stir until blended.Spoon the batter into the paper cupcake liners, on top of the graham-style crust. Sprinkle with 1 teaspoon of the mini chocolate chips, and the remaining cookie crumb mixture.Bake in preheated oven for 18-20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the middle of the cupcake comes out clean. Remove from oven and allow to sit for 5 minutes before removing from the pan to a cooling rack. Allow to cool completely before frosting.Place the egg whites, sugar and cream of tartar in the heatproof bowl of an electric mixer. Set over a saucepan with simmering water in it, and whisk constantly until the sugar is dissolved and the whites are warm to the touch (about 3-4 minutes).Transfer the bowl to your stand mixer, fitted with a whisk attachment. Starting slow, and gradually increase the speed, beat until stiff, glossy peaks form (about 5-7 minutes). Add vanilla and mix until incorporated. Use immediately.Frost the Marshmallow Frosting onto your cupcakes using piping bag fitted with a large tip (or just the coupling), or snip the corner off a resealable bag. Place the cupcakes on a cookie sheet, and use a small kitchen torch, carefully toast the frosting until it is a light brown colour. Be sure to keep the torch moving, as it browns really fast. Also, be sure to keep the flame from the torch away from the paper cupcake liners."},{"vegetarian":false,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":true,"dairyFree":false,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":false,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":16,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":false,"servings":4,"preparationMinutes":10,"cookingMinutes":40,"sourceUrl":"http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/461642/keema-with-peas","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/keema-with-peas-218564","aggregateLikes":234,"creditText":"BBC Good Food","sourceName":"BBC Good Food","extendedIngredients":[{"id":10011693,"aisle":"Canned and Jarred","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/tomatoes-canned.jpg","name":"canned tomatoes","amount":0.5,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"½ a can chopped tomatoes (freeze the rest), or use 2 medium fresh tomatoes","metaInformation":["fresh","medium","chopped","canned","(freeze the rest)"]},{"id":11819,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/red-chili.jpg","name":"chillies","amount":2,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"2 green chillies","metaInformation":["green"]},{"id":2012,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ground-coriander.jpg","name":"coriander","amount":1,"unit":"bunch","unitShort":"bunch","unitLong":"bunch","originalString":"1 small bunch coriander, chopped","metaInformation":["small","chopped"]},{"id":11304,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/peas.jpg","name":"fresh peas","amount":200,"unit":"g","unitShort":"g","unitLong":"grams","originalString":"200g frozen peas or cooked fresh peas","metaInformation":["fresh","frozen","cooked"]},{"id":93663,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garam-masala.jpg","name":"garam masala","amount":2,"unit":"tbsp","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoons","originalString":"2 tbsp garam masala","metaInformation":[]},{"id":11215,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg","name":"garlic cloves","amount":2,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"2 garlic cloves, chopped","metaInformation":["chopped"]},{"id":11216,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ginger.jpg","name":"ginger","amount":1,"unit":"piece","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"4cm piece ginger, grated","metaInformation":["grated"]},{"id":17224,"aisle":"Meat","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/meat-ground.jpg","name":"lamb mince","amount":500,"unit":"g","unitShort":"g","unitLong":"grams","originalString":"500g lamb mince","metaInformation":[]},{"id":1116,"aisle":"Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-cream.jpg","name":"natural yogurt","amount":2,"unit":"tbsp","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoons","originalString":"2 tbsp natural yogurt","metaInformation":[]},{"id":4582,"aisle":"Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vegetable-oil.jpg","name":"oil","amount":3,"unit":"tbsp","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoons","originalString":"3 tbsp oil","metaInformation":[]},{"id":11282,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-onion.jpg","name":"onion","amount":1,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"1 large onion, chopped","metaInformation":["large","chopped"]},{"id":2043,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/turmeric.jpg","name":"turmeric","amount":2,"unit":"tsp","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"2 tsp turmeric","metaInformation":[]}],"id":218564,"title":"Keema with peas","readyInMinutes":50,"image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Keema-with-peas-218564.jpg","imageType":"jpg","cuisines":[],"instructions":"Chop the onion, garlic, ginger andchillies together in a food processor.

Fold both the sides into the center, and the top and bottomover the center. Roll up into a cylinder—tightly, like a cigar or a smallburrito—and repeat with the remaining leaves. If there happen to beany remaining leaves, you can chop them up and add to the sauce.                                                                            Pour a 1/2-inch layer of the sauce into a 13- by-9-inch casserole dish.Arrange the collard rolls, seam sides down, on top of the sauce. Pourthe remaining sauce over the stuff ed collards, and cover the pan withfoil. Bake in the preheated oven for 40 minutes. Remove from the oven,and serve.                                                                            Reprinted with permission from The Neelys' Celebration Cookbook by Pat and Gina Nelly.

Combine the cream and milk in a measuring cup. Pour half of the mixture into a medium pot, add the garlic, Parmesan, and salt, and set the pot over medium heat. Let the liquid come to a simmer and cook for 1 minute, then turn off the heat.

Let it sit for a few minutes, skimming off the froth that develops on the surface with a spoon. Fold a small kitchen towel into a square, put it into a large baking dish, and set the gratin dish on top. Pour enough water into the pot to come to about an inch from the dish’s rim.                                                                                                                            4                                                                            Carefully put the pot in the oven and cook just until the custard has set; it should be slightly firm around the edges but still wobbly in the middle. Remove the pot from the oven and let the custard cool in the water, then remove it. (You can refrigerate the custard overnight, if you wish. I like to serve it at room temperature.)                                                                                                                            5                                                                            Make the asparagus: Heat the olive oil over medium heat in a heavy pan big enough to hold all the asparagus in one layer just until it begins to smoke. Add the asparagus to the pan, lining up the spears in the same direction. The oil should crackle and sizzle a bit. Give the spears a toss with tongs, sprinkle with a good pinch of salt, and spread out in one layer. Cook, turning the spears occasionally, until they’re golden brown in spots and tender but still snappy, about 6 minutes. Give one of the spears a squeeze—it should give just a little; it shouldn’t feel either very firm or mushy.Just a minute before they’re done, sprinkle the basil over the asparagus and drizzle on a little more olive oil. Flip the spears with tongs and play with the basil a little, giving it time against the hot pan and then moving it back onto the asparagus. It’s nice if it gets just a little crispy.                                                                                                                            6                                                                            Take off the heat and let the asparagus gently finish cooking in the heat of the pan, stirring now and then and sprinkling on a little more salt and maybe a splash of lemon juice, if you’d like, just until you can pick up a spear without scalding your fingers.                                                                                                                            7                                                                            Serve the asparagus on a platter with the custard, prosciutto, and olive oil–lashed toasted or grilled bread alongside."},{"vegetarian":false,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":true,"dairyFree":false,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":false,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":20,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":true,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":true,"servings":6,"preparationMinutes":5,"cookingMinutes":25,"sourceUrl":"http://fedandfit.com/2014/11/15/paleo-pumpkin-curry/","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/paleo-pumpkin-curry-620499","aggregateLikes":105,"creditText":"Fed and Fit","sourceName":"Fed and Fit","extendedIngredients":[{"id":5091,"aisle":"Meat","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chicken-thighs.png","name":"chicken thighs","amount":2,"unit":"pounds","unitShort":"lb","unitLong":"pounds","originalString":"2-3 pounds chicken thighs, cut into 1\" cubes","metaInformation":["cut into 1\" cubes"]},{"id":2015,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/curry-powder.jpg","name":"curry powder","amount":2,"unit":"tablespoons","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoons","originalString":"2 tablespoons curry powder","metaInformation":[]},{"id":11216,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ginger.jpg","name":"fresh ginger","amount":1,"unit":"tablespoon","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoon","originalString":"1 tablespoon fresh ginger, finely shaved","metaInformation":["fresh","shaved","finely"]},{"id":12118,"aisle":"Canned and Jarred","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/coconut-milk.jpg","name":"full-fat coconut milk","amount":13.5,"unit":"ounces","unitShort":"oz","unitLong":"ounces","originalString":"13.5 ounces canned full-fat coconut milk","metaInformation":["canned"]},{"id":93632,"aisle":"Ethnic Foods","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ghee.jpg","name":"ghee","amount":2,"unit":"tablespoons","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoons","originalString":"2 tablespoons ghee, grass-fed butter, or EVCO (extra virgin coconut oil)","metaInformation":["grass-fed","(extra virgin coconut oil)"]},{"id":1002030,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pepper.jpg","name":"ground pepper","amount":0.25,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper","metaInformation":["black"]},{"id":9160,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/lime-juice.jpg","name":"juice of lime","amount":2,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"2 limes, juiced","metaInformation":["juiced"]},{"id":11424,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pumpkin-puree.jpg","name":"pumpkin puree","amount":3,"unit":"cups","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"30 ounces pumpkin puree (about 3 cups)","metaInformation":[]},{"id":1012047,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg","name":"sea salt","amount":0.5,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"1/2 teaspoon plus 1 teaspoon sea salt","metaInformation":[]},{"id":11547,"aisle":"Canned and Jarred","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/tomato-paste.jpg","name":"tomato puree","amount":24,"unit":"ounces","unitShort":"oz","unitLong":"ounces","originalString":"24 ounces tomato puree","metaInformation":[]}],"id":620499,"title":"Paleo Pumpkin Curry","readyInMinutes":30,"image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Paleo-Pumpkin-Curry-620499.jpg","imageType":"jpg","cuisines":["asian","indian"],"instructions":"Melt the butter in a large pot or pan.

Nestle halved heads of garlic around tenderloin and drizzle everything with remaining 1 tablespoon oil.

If pastry is too dry, add 1 tablespoon cold water.Form pastry into a 6 inch disc. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate 1 to 2 hours.In a medium heavy saucepan over medium heat, combine milk, sugar, and butter; bring to a boil, stirring constantly with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon so mixture does not burn. Stir in rice; reduce heat to low and simmer, covered, for 1 hour, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat and let partially cool for 10 to 15 minutes.In a large bowl, combine eggs and cream cheese; beat until blended and smooth. Stir in candied lemon peel, cinnamon, lemon zest, and orange zest. Gradually stir in partially cooled rice mixture. Set aside to cool while handling pastry.Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.On a lightly floured pastry mat or pastry board, and using a lightly floured rolling pin, roll the chilled pastry from the center out into a circle 8 inches in diameter. Place pastry in the bottom of an 8 inch springform pan. Tip: Dont stretch the pastry when placing in the pan, otherwise when baking the heat will cause the pastry to shrink down in the pan. Instead, gently push and pat the pastry in the pan.Pour rice mixture over the bottom pastry.Bake: Slide filled springform pan onto a baking sheet, place in oven. Bake 50 to 60 minutes, or until a kitchen knife inserted near the center comes out clean. Remove from oven; leave flan in pan until cooled and filling is set.When flan is cooled, slide a small knife around the edge of the flan to loosen it and remove the sides of the springform pan, and transfer flan onto a serving plate. Serve while still warm or refrigerate until ready to serve.In a small bowl, combine powdered sugar, and a sprinkling of cinnamon.Before serving, use a fine-mesh sieve to dust the top of the flan with the sugar and cinnamon mixture.Refrigerate leftovers."},{"vegetarian":false,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":false,"dairyFree":false,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":false,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":12,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":false,"servings":12,"preparationMinutes":30,"cookingMinutes":25,"sourceUrl":"http://www.recipegirl.com/2014/12/08/no-yeast-eggnog-cinnamon-rolls/","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/no-yeast-eggnog-cinnamon-rolls-622362","aggregateLikes":237,"creditText":"Recipe Girl","sourceName":"Recipe Girl","extendedIngredients":[{"id":18371,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg","name":"baking powder","amount":1,"unit":"tablespoon","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoon","originalString":"1 tablespoon baking powder","metaInformation":[]},{"id":19334,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-sugar-dark.jpg","name":"brown sugar","amount":1,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cup","originalString":"1 cup packed brown sugar","metaInformation":["packed"]},{"id":1057,"aisle":"Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg-nog.jpg","name":"eggnog","amount":0.5,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"1/2 cup eggnog (don't use light)","metaInformation":["light","(don't use )"]},{"id":1123,"aisle":"Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg","name":"eggs","amount":2,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"2 large Eggland's Best eggs","metaInformation":["large"]},{"id":20081,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png","name":"flour","amount":2,"unit":"cups","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"2 cups all-purpose flour","metaInformation":["all-purpose"]},{"id":20081,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png","name":"flour","amount":12,"unit":"servings","unitShort":"servings","unitLong":"servings","originalString":"more flour, as needed","metaInformation":["as needed"]},{"id":19335,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg","name":"granulated sugar","amount":2,"unit":"tablespoons","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoons","originalString":"2 tablespoons granulated white sugar","metaInformation":["white"]},{"id":2010,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cinnamon.jpg","name":"ground cinnamon","amount":1,"unit":"tablespoon","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoon","originalString":"1 tablespoon ground cinnamon","metaInformation":[]},{"id":19336,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/powdered-sugar.jpg","name":"powdered sugar","amount":1,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cup","originalString":"1 cup powdered sugar (sifted to remove lumps)","metaInformation":["sifted","( to remove lumps)"]},{"id":2047,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg","name":"salt","amount":1,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoon","originalString":"1 teaspoon salt","metaInformation":[]},{"id":1145,"aisle":"Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg","name":"unsalted butter","amount":3,"unit":"tablespoons","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoons","originalString":"3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted","metaInformation":["unsalted","melted"]}],"id":622362,"title":"No Yeast Eggnog Cinnamon Rolls","readyInMinutes":55,"image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/No-Yeast-Eggnog-Cinnamon-Rolls-622362.jpg","imageType":"jpg","cuisines":[],"instructions":"1.

slices crosswise into 1/2 wide pieces.In a large Dutch oven set over medium heat, cook the bacon until nice and crispy. Remove to a plate with a slotted spoon and set aside.Add the onions and salt to the Dutch oven and cook, stirring often, until caramelized - about 15-20 minutes. Add paprika and black pepper and stir until well combined. Add shredded cabbage and cook, stirring, for a few minutes until all the ingredients are evenly distributed, then throw in apple dice and cooked bacon. In a large measuring cup, mix the chicken stock, apple cider vinegar, Dijon mustard, spices and chopped rosemary together with a whisk. Pour that over the cabbage and stir to combine, then cook over medium heat for about 15 minutes, until the cabbage is softened and the liquid is almost completely evaporated.Add the toasted hazelnuts and fresh parsley, mix them in let this rest for 10 to 15 minutes, then give one final toss and serve. This will keep for up to 5 days in the refrigerator and actually tastes better after it's had a chance to sit for a day or two."},{"vegetarian":false,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":true,"dairyFree":true,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":false,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":6,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":false,"servings":4,"sourceUrl":"http://www.marthastewart.com/355175/bacon-wrapped-corn","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/bacon-wrapped-corn-146277","aggregateLikes":85,"creditText":"Martha
