Roll each into a 12-in. rope; brush with butter. In a shallow bowl, combine the pecans, sugar and cinnamon; roll ropes in nut mixture.                                                                                           Twist two ropes together; pinch ends to seal. Place in a greased 10-oz. custard cup. Repeat with remaining ropes. Cover and let rise for 30 minutes or until doubled.                                                                                            Bake at 375° for 15-20 minutes or until golden brown.

		"instructions": "1. To make Quenelles: Bring milk and butter to a simmer in saucepan over medium heat until butter melts. Stir in flours, and cook 2 to 3 minutes, or until mixture is thickened and smooth, stirring constantly. Remove from heat, and stir in egg, egg yolk, and Gruyère. Season with salt and pepper, if desired. Spread mixture on rimmed baking sheet. Cover with plastic wrap, pressing it directly onto dough, and cool 2 hours.    2. Meanwhile, to make Tomato Sauce: Heat oil in saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and garlic, and sauté 3 to 5 minutes, or until softened. Stir in tomatoes, tomato purée, and thyme, and cook 7 to 8 minutes. Stir in 2 cups water, and season with salt and pepper, if desired. Cook 5 minutes more. Stir in sugar, if using. Transfer mixture to food processor, and purée until smooth.     3. Preheat oven to 350°F. Bring 2 quarts water to a simmer in large saucepan over medium heat. Roll semolina dough into 8 4-inch logs on well-floured work surface to make Quenelles. Slide Quenelles into simmering water with spatula, and cook 8 to 10 minutes. (Quenelles will sink to bottom; when cooked they rise to the surface.) Transfer with slotted spoon to paper-towel-lined platter.     4. Spread 4 cups Tomato Sauce in 8-inch square gratin or casserole dish. (Reserve remaining 11/2 cups Tomato Sauce for another use.) Arrange Quenelles in Tomato Sauce. Sprinkle Gruyère over Quenelles. Bake 15 minutes, or until cheese on top is melted and sauce is bubbling hot."

Special equipment: a 10-by-15-inch rimmed baking sheetPreheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Cut the onion in half, and shred each half on the large holes of a box grater. Squeeze the shredded onion dry between 2 towels, and scatter around a 10-by-15-inch rimmed baking sheet.Put the ground beef, egg, breadcrumbs and 1 teaspoon salt in a large bowl, and mix gently, just enough to incorporate evenly. Drop mounds of the mixture all around the baking sheet, and press them into an even layer without disturbing the onions too much (but expect some of the onions to move around and peek through the meat). Brush the top of the meat with the vegetable oil, then season it evenly with 1/2 teaspoon salt and several grinds of fresh pepper. Score the meat into 24 squares, cutting completely through with a spatula.Bake until browned and no longer pink in the middle, 8 to 9 minutes. Put a small square of cheese on each patty, and return to the oven to melt, about 30 seconds. Let rest a few minutes, then recut along the scores to separate.Top each patty with a slice of tomato and pickle. Slide a spatula into the pan, and let guests serve themselves. Serve alongside a platter with the buns and lettuce. Don't forget the ketchup and mustard.Copyright 2014 Television Food Network, G.P.

You should end up with 25 balls from this recipe. Alternatively, you could place the mix into a 9 x 9 pan lined with parchment and cut into squares. Rolling these into balls is way less work though!Enjoy right away or pop into the fridge for 15-20 minutes to firm up.Store in a sealed bag or air-tight container in the fridge for up to a week."

		"instructions": "Preparation                                                        Heat the oil in a large heavy pan over medium-low heat and sweat the onions until soft and translucent.                                                                In a separate pan, warm all the spice seeds until they release their fragrance and just begin to jump in the pan. Tip into a mortar and grind with the pestle while still warm.                                                                Add the warm ground spices to the onions along with the chiles, curry leaves, lime leaves, and cilantro. Cook for another 5 minutes over fairly low heat, then add the garlic, jaggery, lime juice, and fish sauce. Stir well and cook for 5 minutes.                                                                 Add the tomatoes, stir well, and cook for another 10 minutes, then add the fresh or cooked dried beans and coconut milk. Cook gently for 10 to 15 minutes (or until the beans are tender if cooking fresh).                                                                While the curry is cooking, wash the wild garlic very well, picking over each leaf thoroughly for they can carry little stones.                                                                A couple of minutes before serving the curry, add the wild garlic and cook until it is just wilted and soft. Don't overcook it—wild garlic should be bright and vibrant. Taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary. This curry should be soft, fragrant, gently sweet, sharp, and salty, with just enough heat to warm you.

Add the sparkling water and then the olive oil. Set aside for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, stir together the harissa and mayonnaise in a bowl and set aside. For the fritto misto, bring 3 inches canola oil to 375 degrees F in a large, heavy-bottomed deep pot. Line 2 plates or a rack with paper towels. Whisk together the egg whites and salt until they hold stiff peaks. Fold into the batter. Pat dry the vegetables and prawns and dip, a few at a time, into the batter and then into the oil. Fry in small batches, starting with the sage and ending with the prawns, until golden and the vegetables are crisp-tender, about 3 minutes, depending on the size, turning to brown on both sides.

Set aside.For the Tempura Batter/Tuna:Whisk all ingredients together in a large bowl, but do not over mix. Keep well chilled in the refrigerator or over an ice bath until ready to use.In a deep-fryer or stockpot, heat the oil to 350 to 375 degrees F. Cut the tuna into 2 portions. Dip each piece into the tempura batter, coating all of the sides. Lower into the deep-fryer and cook until the batter is crisp, but not overly browned, approximately 1 minute. Remove from the fryer to a cutting board and cut into 1/4 to 1/2-inch slices. Transfer the tuna to a serving platter and serve with the Pickled Ginger Tartar Sauce and the Wasabi Guacamole.This recipe was provided by professional chefs and has been scaled down from a bulk recipe provided by a restaurant.

The reduction should yield 1/2 cup of vinegar.  Store in an air tight container.Prepare asparagus by cutting off about 1 inch of the bottom end of the asparagus, lay asparagus on a sheet pan drizzle with oil and sprinkle with salt.  Roast on medium heat on an grill for about 10 minutes turning the asparagus over.  Cooking time with vary with the thickness of the asparagus.   Remove asparagus from grill when done.   If desired squeeze 1/2 of a lemon over the asparagus.  I do not think the Olive Garden does this, but I think it really helps to bring out the flavor of the asparagus.Prepare Parmesan sauce by adding heavy cream and 2 tablespoons of grated Parmesan cheese in a small pot or skillet.  Simmer on low for about 10 - 12 minutes.  The cream should reduce by 20% in volume.To prepare plate some of the cooked asparagus on a plate, drizzle balsamic vinegar on top.  Garnish with 1 tablespoon Parmesan cheese, and then serve with the sauce.  Garnish with fresh chopped tomatoes if desired."

Meanwhile, spread pecans in a pie plate and bake for 8 to 10 minutes, or until fragrant. Let cool and chop coarsely.Whisk together eggs and brown sugar in a large bowl. Blend in evaporated milk, vanilla, cinnamon and nutmeg. Stir in the toasted bread, pecans and raisins. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or up to 1 hour.Meanwhile, lightly coat a shallow 2-quart baking dish with canola oil or nonstick cooking spray. Sprinkle with 1/2 tablespoon of the sugar. Melt butter in a small saucepan over low heat. Skim off froth and cook until it begins to turn light nutty brown, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. (Be careful not to burn the butter.) Transfer to a small bowl and let cool.Pour the bread mixture into the prepared baking dish. Drizzle browned butter over the top and sprinkle with the remaining 1/2 tablespoon sugar. Bake the pudding for 40 minutes, or until firm in the center. Increase the oven temperature to 425F and bake for 10 to 15 minutes longer, or until the top is brown and puffed.To make Bourbon Sauce: Meanwhile, place a deep mixing bowl, beaters and evaporated skim milk in the freezer to chill for 20 minutes. Beat evaporated milk in the chilled bowl, using an electric mixer, for 1 to 2 minutes, or until it is the consistency of whipped cream. Gradually add sugar, bourbon and yogurt and beat for several minutes longer, or until thickened. Serve over warm bread pudding."

Gently scrape out the leaves in the center of the artichoke as well as the fuzzy \"choke\". Rinse the artichoke under cool water. Press the garlic cloves inside the center of artichoke, drizzle lightly with 1 teaspoon olive oil. Combine the remaining olive oil, salt and lemon juice together in a bowl. Rub over the artichoke, making sure to get the areas where you cut to keep them from turning brown. Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour and 20 minutes or until the artichoke is tender and the leaves pull away easily.  Remove the garlic cloves from the center and mash together in a bowl. Add in mayonnaise, lemon juice and lemon zest. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve with artichoke."

Allow the mixture to sit for 10 to 15 minutes until it  becomes gel.In a large measuring jug, add the dry ingredients - almond meal, baking powder and stir with a fork until well combined.  Then add the wet ingredients - water, oil, maple syrup and chia seeds gel into the dry ingredients. Stir until well mixed. Unlike the conventional pancake batter which is pourable, this flourless version resembles thick muffin batter.Lightly grease a small pan with cooking oil and place over medium flame. When the pan is hot, spoon a tablespoon full of batter, gently flattened with the back of the spoon. Cook the pancake over low-medium heat until the pancake are golden brown on both sides. Repeat with the remaining batter. (Note - start by cooking one at a time to familiarise with the batter i,e, the time it will take you to flip the pancake etc.)Serve with seasonal fruits and maple syrup."

Add the butter and pulse until the mixture resembles coarse meal with some bigger pieces of butter. Add the ice water and pulse just until the crumbs begin to come together. Add a little more water if necessary but try not to add too much. Turn the mixture out onto a big sheet of plastic wrap, form it into a disc, wrap it and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough to an even 1/8- to 1/4-inch thickness. Using a 3-inch cookie cutter, cut out 16 to 20 circles. Transfer to a rimmed baking sheet and chill while you make the filling.For the filling: In a small saucepan, combine the peaches, granulated sugar and cornstarch. Bring to a boil over medium heat, mashing the peaches with a fork, and cook until the mixture has thickened, 6 to 8 minutes. Stir in the bourbon to taste. Let cool completely, about 30 minutes.In a small bowl, whisk together the egg and salt. On a rimmed baking sheet lined with parchment, lay out half of the dough discs. Dollop 1 to 2 tablespoons of the filling in the center of each disc. Brush around the edges of the pastry with some of the egg mixture. Top with another dough disc, pressing the edges with a fork to seal. Brush the tops with the egg mixture and sprinkle with coarse sugar.

Whisk together egg and sugar in separate bowl. Stir into flour mixture. Add 4 to 5 Tbs. cold water, just enough to make dough stick together. Shape dough into ball, wrap in plastic wrap, and chill 1 hour, or overnight.2. Preheat oven to 325°F. Spray 12-cup muffin pan with cooking spray.3. To make Filling: Place milk, sugar, eggs, egg yolks, and vanilla and almond extracts in blender, and blend until smooth. Strain through fine mesh strainer into small pitcher or 4-cup measuring cup.4. Roll out chilled Dough to 1/8-inch thickness on well-floured work surface. Cut out 12 rounds with 3-inch round cookie cutter. Press Dough rounds into prepared muffin pan. Fill crusts three-quarters full with Filling. Bake 15 minutes. Top each tart with 1 almond, and bake 15 to 20 minutes more, or until custard is set. Cool; then unmold tarts using knife tip to loosen."

Transfer fudge mixture into baking pan and top with additional crushed Oreos.Let fudge sit at room temperature, loosely covered, for a good 8 hours before cutting into squares.If you want to wrap the fudge into wax paper wrappers, you’ll want to do this before the fudge sets up all of the way. I’d say after 2 hours, spoon out your fudge and wrap in pieces of wax paper. You can also freeze the fudge for 35 minutes, then spoon your fudge for the wrappers."

		"instructions": "Rinse the lobster, and hold it belly up. At the bottom of the tail, there is a small opening, stick a long skewer in it to drain any urine left in its' body, then crack the tail off, chop the tail into small pieces, and crack the claws in half as well. If you know how to eat the body of the lobster, cut it up and throw it on the pile too.                            Heat half of the peanut oil in a deep heavy skillet over medium heat. Add the crushed garlic, and fry for about 1 minute. Throw in the lobster pieces, and fry until they are cooked through, about 4 to 5 minutes. Remove the lobster and garlic mixture to a dish and keep warm.                            Heat the remaining oil in the skillet. Add the minced ginger and pork, and fry until the pork is no longer pink. Pour in the chicken broth, and bring to a boil, stirring constantly. In a small bowl, mix together the sherry, soy sauce, cornstarch and brown sugar until well blended. Add the sherry mixture to the pan, and stir-fry for a minute or two, until the sauce becomes thick and somewhat clear.                            Stir in the green onions, and turn the heat off. Drizzle the beaten eggs over the mixture in the pan, and stir until the eggs are in little pieces. Finally, return the lobster to the pan, and cook over low heat for a few minutes to blend the flavors. Transfer to a serving dish, and let stand, covered, for a few minutes before serving. Eat with steamed rice and enjoy, cause you worked hard!                                                Kitchen-Friendly View"

		"instructions": "1. Rub both sides of each of the steaks with some cooking oil. Season steaks with salt and pepper on both sides. 2. Heat a large frying pan or grill pan over high heat. When very hot, add the steaks. Cook both sides until desired doneness - timing depends on thickness of steak. Generally, for 1-inch thick steak, I grill 5 minutes per side then check with meat thermometer (145F is medium-rare, 160F is medium). Remove steaks to a plate and tent with tin foil to rest.3. Return the same frying pan to the stove, heat the butter over medium heat. When the butter starts bubbling, add the onions and saute until the onions are soft, transluscent and just slightly golden. Take care not to burn the onions by keeping your heat on medium or even medium-low. This will take about 3 minutes. Add the garlic and saute for an additional minute until the garlic is fragrant.4. Turn your heat to medium-high and add the mushrooms all at once. Immediately start tossing so that the onion/garlic/butter mixture is evenly distributed amongst the mushrooms. Saute the mushrooms until they are browned and softened, about 3-5 minutes depending on the thickness and size of your mushrooms.5. Season with salt, pepper and nutmeg. Pour in the whiskey and the balsamic vinegar and let the mixture bubble a bit to burn off some of the alcohol. Turn the heat down just a bit and add in the heavy cream. Let it bubble for another 30 seconds and then taste to adjust the salt. Stir in the freshly minced herbs and pour over just-grilled steak."

Add the carrots and celery and cook for a few more minutes.2. Add the lentils, the stock, and the rosemary and bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer gently for 45-50 minutes, or until the lentils are very soft. If it is too thick at this point (I like it this way, but you might not), you can add more liquid and cook your soup a bit more. Add the vinegar, mix well, and season to taste with coarse sea salt before serving."

Tips: Pour excess portion(s) into glasses and freeze ahead for later (30 seconds in the microwave is what I do to thaw in a hurry); pour excess into bowls and freeze for apple pie frozen yogurt; or pour into Popsicle molds, paper cups, or ice cube trays and freeze for homemade frozen treats. Optional: Add 1 to 2 ounces of Rum, Vodka, Marshmallow Vodka, Apple Vodka, Apple Schnapps, Gran Marnier or similar, per smoothie portion, or to taste.  Or add 1 to 2 scoops of vanilla or plain protein powder.  Use caramel sauce in the mixture or drizzled over the top before drinking."

		"instructions": "Directions                                                        Combine the soy sauce, garlic, sugar and peppercorns in a large bowl. Add the pork and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours or overnight, covered (can be marinated in a resealable 1-gallon freezer bag). Mix twice at regular intervals to marinate thoroughly.Drain the pork in a colander over a bowl; reserve the marinade and garlic. Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven over medium heat. Brown the pork in batches, making sure not to crowd the meat and turning often until all sides are brown, 6 to 8 minutes per batch (the peppercorns may adhere to the pork, which is fine). Watch closely: The sugar in the marinade will cause the pork to darken quickly if the pot is too hot-lower the heat if necessary to avoid burning. Remove the pork with a slotted spoon; set aside.Discard all but 2 tablespoons of the oil from the Dutch oven. Add the garlic from the marinade and the onions, and cook, stirring, until the onions are translucent, 10 to 12 minutes.Add back the pork, the strained marinade, 1 cup water and the bay leaves, and bring to a boil. Lower the heat to medium, cover and cook at a medium boil, stirring periodically, until the pork is tender but not falling apart, about 1 hour and 25 minutes. The cooking liquid will be reduced by at least 2/3.Add the vinegar, but do not stir. Cook, uncovered, until the sauce is reduced to the consistency of a loose marinara, about 20 minutes more. Remove from the heat, and skim and discard fat (pork belly will render a good amount). Allow the pork and sauce to sit 15 minutes before serving; the sauce will continue to thicken. Serve over jasmine rice.Copyright 2014 Television Food Network, G.P. All rights reserved.

Place a wire rack on a baking sheet. Transfer steaks to wire rack; refrigerate for 1 hour. In the same skillet, saute mushrooms and onions in butter until tender; drain. Stir in the salt and pepper.                                                                                           On a lightly floured surface, roll pastry into a 13-in. square.

Bake, uncovered, at 400° for 20-25 minutes or until pastry is golden brown and meat reaches desired doneness (for medium-rare, a meat thermometer should read 145°; medium, 160°; well-done, 170°).

Bake at 325°F for approximately 50 minutes, or until the center of the custard has just set (can still be a little wiggly).  Remove from oven and let cool.  The custard may puff up a bit in the oven; it will deflate as it cools.3 Whip the chilled cream until it holds stiff peaks.  Once the pie has cooled to room temperature, spread the whipping cream over the top of the pie.  Arrange the raspberries and blueberries in a decorative pattern on top of the whipping cream.Serve immediately or chill until ready to serve."

		"imageType": "png",
		"instructions": "Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.Make pie crust according to recipe.  Roll out the crust into a 8 x 10 rectangle between two sheets of waxed paper.  Use a kitchen ruler and a chef’s knife to trim the edges neatly.  If the dough is too soft to remove the cut edges, put it back in the refrigerator for 10 minutes or so.Now comes the fun part.  Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray.  Rip off a piece of parchment paper that will cover the baking spray.  Remove the top piece of waxed paper.  Place the parchment paper on top of the dough.  Turn the dough over and place on the prepared baking sheet with the parchment paper on the baking sheet.  Remove the top piece of waxed paper.  Smile.  You just made the perfect gluten-free crust.  Put the dough back in the refrigerator while you get the apples ready.Fill a medium bowl with cold ice water and mix in the lemon juice.  This will keep your apples from browning.  Peel your apples and put them in the water.  Cut them in half, use your knife to cut out the stem and seeds, then use a melon baller to remove any remaining seeds if necessary.  Slice ¼ inch thick.  Keep the apples in the water until you’re ready to use them.Place the apples diagonally on the pie crust, overlapping them slightly, starting with the longest length.  Work your way out in rows and fill in empty spots with a piece of apple cut to fit.  Warm agave in microwave for 15 – 20 seconds and brush over the apples.  Sprinkle with cinnamon – you don’t need to use it all.  Dot with butter, and then bake for 25 – 30 minutes rotating at the 15 minute mark.  The apples should be browned in spots and the edges of the tart will be brown too.  Don’t worry if the juices run and brown around the tart.  This is ok.Mix apricot preserves with 2 tablespoons of water and heat in microwave for 20 seconds.  Brush over entire tart and return to oven for another 5 to 8 minutes.  Remove from oven and let cool.  Gently slide onto a large cutting board and slice into desired size.  Serve warm or at room temperate.Sift together white rice flour, sorghum flour, potato starch, sweet rice flour, and salt.  Place into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment.  Working quickly, dice the butter into small pieces and place it evenly around the flour.  Turn the mixer on stir until the flour has a mealy texture and the butter has worked itself into chunks about the size of small peas.Put ¼ cup water in a 1 cup glass measuring cup and add ice.  Set aside.Lightly beat the egg.  Add the vinegar and agave to the egg and mix well.  Pour egg mix into the flour with the mixer on and stir just until incorporated.With mixer on stir, drizzle water into flour mixture just until the dough starts to come together.  You can push the dough together with your hands, so don’t worry about loose pieces.  It needs to be just wet enough to stick together.Turn dough out onto a piece of waxed paper.  Depending on what you’re going to make, shape the dough accordingly.  If you’re going to make a pie crust, shape the dough into a ball.  If you’re going to make a rectangle tart, then shape it into a rectangle.  Wrap in waxed paper, then again in saran wrap, and place in the refrigerator for several hours or up to one day.Remove dough from refrigerator about 20 minutes before you want to roll it out.  Place between two sheets of waxed paper and roll into desired shape and about 1/8 inch thick.  If your dough cracks around the edges, just take a wet finger and repair the crack."

		"instructions": "In a large pot, set over high heat, whisk together the can of coconut milk and 1/2 cup of Honey (or agave), reserving the remaining honey for later. Bring the mixture to a boil and boil for 1 minute, stirring constantly. Then, turn the heat down to medium and and simmer for 20 minutes, stirring frequently, until the sauce reduced by about half. Transfer the sauce to a large measuring cup to cool while you make the crust. Note: You should have about 1 1/4 cups of sauce left after cooking it. Once you've made the sauce, heat your oven to 350 degrees and line an 8x8 inch pan with parchment paper, spraying the sides generously with coconut oil spray. Note: It helps to spray the bottom of the pan before putting in the parchment paper, to secure it. In a large bowl, using an electric hand mixer, beat the remaining 3 Tbsp of honey with the coconut oil until smooth and creamy. Stir in the flour and pinch of salt until a wet dough forms. Press the dough evenly into the bottom of the pan. This will be a little bit tough, just be patient with it. I found it easiest to use the palms of my hands, and rinse them off every so often, until the dough was pressed in. Bake the crust just until lightly golden brown, about 7 mins. Note: this would be a good time to chop the nuts if you haven't already) As soon as the crust comes out of the often, sprinkle the chopped nuts on top, and lightly press them into the crust. Then, sprinkle on the chocolate chips evenly, followed by the coconut flakes. Pour 1 Cup of the slightly cooled coconut milk mixture (you'll have a little left over, but you don't need to use it all for these bars) EVENLY over the top of the surface. Then, gently shake the pan around until the coconut milk mixture begins to sink between the layers. Place into the oven and bake until the sides are lightly golden brown, about 27-28 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool to room temperature. Then, cover with tinfoil and refrigerate overnight. ** The next day, run a very sharp knife around the edge of the pan, slice into bars and DEVOUR"

This helps speed up baking time.Rub the potatoes on both sides with olive oil and sprinkle salt and pepper on both sides. Place face down on the prepared baking sheet.Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until potatoes are fork tender.In a small sauce pan, heat the milk over medium heat until you see bubbles forming at the top.Meanwhile, melt the butter in another saucepan over medium heat. Sprinkle the flour over the top, stirring constantly until a thick paste forms, 1 to 2 minutes.Slowly add the warm milk to the flour and butter paste in a steady stream, whisking constantly. Continue cooking, whisking constantly until the mixture thickens, about 5 minutes. It should be thick but still pourable. Add the cheese, whisking constantly until it is melted. Add the hot sauce and cayenne. Stir in the broccoli and bacon. Taste, then add salt and pepper to taste. Add more cayenne and/or hot sauce if preferred. If the mixture is too thick, you can add a little bit more milk until desired consistency.Spoon hot cheese sauce over baked potatoes and serve immediately."
