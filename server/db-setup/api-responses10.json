Add the cooked pasta and stir in the remaining olive oil and the Parmesan.

      "instructions": "Make the glaze1. [Editor's Note: Be sure to make the glaze before you bake the cakes.] In a large saucepan over medium-low heat, melt the butter. Add the chocolate and stir until melted. Add the sugar and stir until it dissolves. Then stir in the evaporated milk, vanilla, and the instant coffee.2. Cook the glaze over medium-high heat until it boils. Reduce the heat to low and continue cooking, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens, about 20 minutes.3. Remove the glaze from the heat. When cooled a bit, return to low heat as needed, as the glaze must be warm to spread on the cake layers.Make the cake4. Preheat the oven to 350°F (176°C). Butter and flour at least four 9-inch cake pans.5. Cream the butter and sugar until smooth. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating just until blended after each addition. In a small bowl, mix the vanilla with the milk. Add the flour to the egg mixture alternately with the milk mixture, beginning and ending with the flour.6. Pour a very thin layer of batter—about 7 tablespoons—into each pan, shaking the pans to distribute the batter to the edges. Bake the layers for 11 to 13 minutes. Immediately remove the layers from the pans and, working one at a time, place the layers on a cake stand and immediately frost with the rewarmed glaze. Bake all of the remaining batter in this manner. You should be able to get 12 layers from this recipe. Continue to stack the layers, sandwiching them with glaze, reserving the last of the glaze to dribble over the top of the cake."

Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.                                                                                                                             2                                                                            Sift flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt into medium bowl; set aside.                                                                                                                            3                                                                            In bowl of standing mixer fitted with paddle attachment, cream butter with sugars on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 1 minute. Add egg and vanilla until combined.                                                                                                                             4                                                                            Reduce speed to low and add dry ingredients until just combined, scraping down sides of bowl as necessary to incorporate ingredients evenly.  Add chocolate chips, white chocolate chips, and pistachios until just combined.                                                                                                                            5                                                                            Evenly place 12 heaping tablespoons of dough onto prepared pans, spacing 2 inches apart. Gently roll each piece of dough into a ball and press down gently until slightly flattened. Sprinkle a few flakes of sea salt on top of each cookie.                                                                                                                             6                                                                            Bake until cookies have puffed and small cracks appear, about 13 minutes, rotating pans from top to bottom and front to back halfway through baking. Let cookies cool on pans for 5 minutes, then transfer cookies to wire rack to cool completely. Repeat with remaining cookies."

      "instructions": "Pretzel Bites - To the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook (or large mixing bowl and hand-knead), combine flour, water, yeast, oil, sugar, optional salt, and knead for about 5 minutes, or until dough is soft, smooth, and has come together in a firm mass. If hand-kneading, you may need to knead a few minutes longer. Based brand of yeast used, water temperature will vary. Red Star Platinum yeast calls for a warmer temperature than most, 120 to 130F; other brands are lower, about 95 to 105F. Warm water according to the yeast manufacturer's recommendations on the packaging. Taking the temperature with a digital thermometer is recommended, but if you're not, make sure the water is warm, not hot. Err on the cooler rather than hotter side so you don't kill the yeast. Turn dough out onto a Silpat-lined countertop (provides nice traction) or just the bare counter. Divide dough in 4 equal-sized pieces. Roll each piece of dough into a long rope spanning the length of a standard baking sheet (my baking sheet is 17 inches long). Place the ropes onto a Silpat-lined  or cooking sprayed baking sheet. Score the dough with a pizza cutter into 1-inch pieces. Separate the pieces so they're not touching; set pan aside while oven preheats. Preheat oven to 350F; this generally takes about 10 to 15 minutes and this is all the dough rises for. Bake for about 16 to 17 minutes, or until barely golden, firm, and cooked through (taste one to make sure). Keep a watchful eye in the last few minutes of baking so they don't burn. Set pan aside while you melt the butter, about 30 seconds on high power in the microwave. With the bites still on the baking tray (nicely contains the butter mess), brush generously with melted butter; set aside. Chocolate Coating - In a small bowl, stir to combine the cocoa and sugar until well mixed. Turn mixture out into a gallon-sized ziptop bag. Add about half the pretzels to the bag, seal the top, and gently shake to disperse coating mixture evenly over pretzels, continuing to tip the bag from side to side, upside-down, and back and forth. Open bag and serve. Cinnamon-Sugar Coating - In a small bowl, stir to combine the cinnamon and sugar until well mixed. Turn mixture out into a gallon-sized ziptop bag. Add about half the pretzels to the bag, seal the top, and gently shake to disperse coating mixture evenly over pretzels, continuing to tip the bag from side to side, upside-down, and back and forth. Open bag and serve. Pretzels are best warm and fresh, but will keep airtight for up to 2 days. Before eating leftovers, heat for 5 seconds in micro to soften them up.

Once the butter melts, add the tortilla strips and cook, stirring and tossing, until they are all golden and crispy.Cook the vegetables: When the tortillas are crisp, add the bell pepper, chiles and onion to the skillet. Season with a pinch of salt and a few grinds of black pepper. Cook until tender, about 5 minutes.Add the eggs to the pan, season with salt and reduce the heat to medium low. Cook, stirring to scramble and combine, until most of the moisture is cooked out, then remove from the heat. Stir in the tomatoes.

Cover (not airtight), and allow to rest at room temperature until dough rises and collapses (or flattens on top), approximately 2 hours.The dough can be used immediately after the initial rise, though though not only is it easier to handle when cold, but I think it also produces a better crust. Refrigerate in a lidded (not airtight) container and use over the next 12 days.Heat the oven to 500 degrees. Place the cast iron pizza pan or pizza stone (unless you are using a metal pizza pan) in the oven to heat up.Melt the butter in a small dish. Add the olive oil and garlic salt and stir to combine. Roll out the pizza dough on a floured sheet of wax or parchment paper  (we actually do the ol' toss method which keeps our dough nice and airy) and brush with the butter, garlic salt mixture. Top with cheese and slide the dough carefully onto the hot pizza pan and place right back in the oven. Bake for 5-10 minutes or until hot and bubbly."

Reduce heat to medium-low.  Crack eggs into separate small bowls (not into the pan - this works much better, I promise!) and slide them in the pan.  Cook them for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes and then gently flip them.  Cook them for another 15-30 seconds and then slide them out of the pan onto a plate.  3.  Assemble sandwiches as follows: Toast, spread generously with mayo, grind some pepper on the mayo, lettuce (you will probably have to fold the lettuce in half), tomato, bacon, egg, more mayo on the top piece of toast.  Take a big bite.  Be very happy."

      "instructions": "For the Banana Coconut Cake: Preheat to 350 degrees F. Grease and flour three 9-inch cake pans.Cream the butter and sugar on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 4-5 minutes. Add the eggs whites, vanilla and smashed banana. Beat on medium speed until combined, scraping down bowl as needed.Combine the flour, baking soda, salt and baking powder in a medium bowl.Add 1/3 of the flour mixture and beat on low, until combined. Add half the buttermilk, beat until combined. Continue alternating ingredients, ending with the flour. Scrape the sides and bottom of bowl as needed.Finally add the shredded coconut and mix to combine.Divide the batter into prepared pans. Bake for 25-35 minutes until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean.Allow the cakes to cool in the pans on a cooling rack for 10 minutes. Invert the cakes onto the cooling racks and cool completely.Wrap each cake separately and freeze.For the Whipped Chocolate Frosting: Place all the ingredients in a clean mixing bowl and beat on high until stiff peaks form.Unwrap the frozen cakes. Divide 1/4 of the whipped frosting on the bottom layer, 1/4 on the middle layer, and 1/2 of the frosting on the top layer. Spread the frosting evenly over the bottom layers, then stack the three cakes, level, and spread the large amount of frosting (on the top layer) over the top and down the sides.Press the shredded coconut around the bottom half and the cake and place in the fridge to chill.For the Chocolate Ganache: Heat the heavy cream in the microwave until it simmers. Remove and add the chocolate. Allow it to sit for 10 minutes then add the corn syrup and gently stir. Once smooth, tap the bowl on the counter to remove bubbles. Cool to room-temperature.Once the ganache is cool, pour over the top of the cake and spread to the sides, allowing the ganache to run down.Chill until ready to serve. *When serving, I like to cut the slices then allow them to sit for a few minutes so the cake warms up a little."

This will make it easier to remove the granola bars.Combine oats, cooked quinoa, 1/2 cup coconut, flaxseed, almonds, and dark chocolate chips in a bowl and mix together.In a small saucepan, over medium heat, mix honey, brown sugar and salt. Stir until it comes to a slight boil.Remove from heat, stir in the almond butter, coconut extract and vanilla until incorporated. Let cool slightly, but still keep warm enough to be pourable.Pour the warm mixture over the dry ingredients and mix until well combined. The chocolate will begin to melt. Work as quickly as possible so as not to work the chocolate too much.Add mixture to the prepared pan and with a piece of parchment paper press down to even out the surface. Sprinkle the remaining 1/2 cup of coconut on top of the bars, and press down with the back of a spoon. Let cool down completely, then cool in the refrigerator for at least an hour before eating. Cut into bars, and store in an airtight container, separating layers with parchment paper. Store in the refrigerator. Will stay good for about a week."

      "instructions": "Make the spaetzle dough by whisking together the flour, salt, pepper and nutmeg in a large bowl. In a separate small bowl, beat the pumpkin puree, eggs and buttermilk until well combined. Add the egg mixture to the flour, and using a wooden spoon or spatula, gently stir together until you have a sticky dough. Depending on your puree and eggs, you may find that your dough is too thick. If that is the case, add a little more milk or water, about a tablespoon at a time, until the sticky dough is on the thin side, almost like a thick pancake batter. Let the dough sit in the refrigerator while you bring some water to a boil. This can even be done the night before.Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Using a spaetzle maker or colander, pass the dough through the holes and drop it into the water. The dumplings will cook quickly and float to the top. Use a slotted spoon to retrieve the spaetzle. Set aside in a colander to drain.Make the browned butter sauce by melting the butter in a saute pan over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook the sauce, stirring, for about 5-7 minutes, until the butter is golden brown. Skim any foam from the sauce and discard. Stir in the spaetzle and parsley,and season with salt and pepper. Toss in a generous sprinkling of parmesan cheese and transfer to a serving dish. Serve while hotwith shavings ofparmesan cheese."

Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer, stirring well until the sugar is dissolved. Reduce heat and allow the syrup to simmer for about 15 minutes.Remove the pot from heat and allow to steep for at least 1 hour.Next discard the cinnamon stick and ginger slices and filter the syrup through a fine mesh strainer to remove the remaining spices.Transfer the gingerbread syrup to a small bottle. This syrup can be made ahead of time and stored in the refrigerator for about 2 months.Yield: 1/2 cup syrupWhile the syrup is steeping, prepare the whipped cream, scald the milk, and brew the coffee.Whipped Cream:Combine the heavy cream, powdered sugar, and vanilla extract in the bowl of a stand mixer.Whip with the whisk attachment for about 3 minutes on medium-high, until whipped cream is firm yet still light and airy.Store in the refrigerator until ready to use.Tip: Place mixing bowl and whisk attachment in the freezer 30 minutes prior to using for best results.Scalded Milk:Place the whole milk in a small, shallow skillet.Slowly heat until just below a simmer. Do not allow to boil or heavily simmer as this will “break” the milk and it will be no good.To Assemble Each Drink:Combine 1 cup brewed coffee, 3 tablespoons scaled milk and 1 fluid ounce gingerbread syrup in a large coffee cup. Stir to combine.Top with whipped cream and enjoy!"

Lightly dust a work surface. Lay out puff pastry sheet, lightly flour top, and roll into an approximate 16- by 16-inch square.                                                                                                                            2                                                                            Spread chicken on puff pastry, leaving a 1 inch border on all edges. Arrange blue cheese on top, then drizzle hot sauce all over, leaving a 1 inch border on all edges.                                                                                                                            3                                                                            Roll puff pastry sheet away from you like a jelly roll. When completely rolled, pinch seam to seal.                                                                                                                            4                                                                            Pinch ends of puff pastry to seal, then roll into a disk-shaped spiral. Place spiral in center of preheated waffle iron. Cook until puff pastry is deep golden brown on all surfaces and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center registers 200°F, about 12 minutes.                                                                                                                            5                                                                            Transfer to a cutting board, cut into wedges, and serve immediately, serving blue cheese dressing and extra hot sauce on the side."

      "instructions": "In a large bowl, whisk together the whole-wheat flour, all-purpose flour, brown sugar, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, nutmeg and orange zest.In a medium microwave-safe bowl melt 3 tablespoons of the butter. Let cool a bit then whisk in the milk, egg and vanilla extract. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and whisk just until combined (some lumps are fine). Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 3 hours, or overnight.***If you want to make all of the pancakes before serving, preheat oven to 200 F. Place a baking sheet lined with foil on the middle rack.***Using the remaining butter, heat about 1 teaspoon butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add 1/4 cup of batter to the pan for each pancake (you can probably make 2 at a time if your pan is large enough). Cook until bubbles appear on the surface of the pancakes and they begin to brown just a bit around the edges, about 2 minutes, then flip and cook on the other side for about 2 minutes more. Move the pancakes to the warm oven (if you need to stack the pancakes on the baking sheet, do so between layers of parchment paper). Wipe the pan with a paper towel, melt another teaspoon of butter and repeat the cooking process.Makes about fourteen 4-inch pancakes"

Make sure you do not cut all the way through. Open each tenderloin and lay it out flat.  Place a piece of wax paper on top and pound it with the flat side of a meat mallet.  Sprinkle both sides of the tenderloins with the dry rub. Combine the cream cheese, broccoli, and 1 cup of the cheddar cheese. Add pepper, to taste  Divide the mixture onto one side of the opened tenderloins.  Close the tenderloins up and wrap each one in 2 slices of bacon. Move the charcoal to one side of the grill to create an indirect heat source so the meat can cook low and slow. The temperature should read around 250 degrees.  Place the stuffed tenderloins on the other side of the grill, close the lid, and cook for about 1 1/2- 2 hours, or until a meat thermometer inserted into the meat reads 145 degrees. Brush each pork bundle with the dressing and top with the remaining cheese.  Close lid for 1-2 minutes or until cheese is melted.  Serve with diced tomatoes and onions.  Makes 8 tenderloins."

In a food processor, pulse the walnuts a few times until chopped. Place in a small skillet over medium high heat with no oil or butter and toast until golden brown, stirring or shaking constantly.Make the dressing: In the small skillet, saute the butter and onion over medium high heat until the onions are golden brown, about 5 minutes. Transfer the onions to a food processor. Add the orange juice, honey, and olive oil. Puree until smooth and creamy. Season generously with salt and pepper.Place the Brussels sprouts in the empty sauteed onion pan and place over high heat. Stir for 1-2 minutes until you can smell them and they turn bright green. Remove from heat. In a large bowl, toss the the Brussels sprouts, walnuts, chicken, and Parmesan.Toss the dressing and salad together. Serve warm or cold. If you plan to keep leftovers, keep the dressing separate."

(You CAN use foil like Ghirardelli recommends, but I think the baking mat is much easier--and it's reusable/better for the planet.)Now, put the butter, sugar, water and salt in a heavy duty saucepan and heat over medium heat. As the butter melts, stir the mixture together well. Stir several times until the mixture comes to a full, rolling boil. Now that it's boiling, STOP stirring and just watch the yellow bubbles cook over medium heat for about 10 - 11 minutes. A couple times (no more than three) during this time, you can run a rubber scraper over the bottom of the pan (a very gentle stir) to make sure nothing is sticking to the bottom. Once it starts to turn brown, don't touch it. Just watch until all the yellowness turns to brown--this will happen quite quickly. As soon as it looks like it's all a proper toffee colored brown (when the candy thermometer says 305, if you're using a thermometer), that's when you remove it from the heat and stir in the vanilla. (Be careful, it might sputter a bit!)Pour the hot brown candy mixture out onto your prepared pan. It will spread a bit. Let it set for a while until it's cool and hardened.Melt the chocolate and spread over the hard toffee, then sprinkle with the toasted nuts and gently press them into the chocolate. Let cool until the chocolate is set, then break the toffee into chunks."

      "instructions": "1.  Prepare the cheesecake layer:  Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.  Place a large roasting pan on the lower third rack of the oven.  Place a kettle of water on the stove to boil.  Spray a 9-inch springform pan with nonstick spray and line the bottom with a round of parchment paper.  Wrap a double layer of foil around the bottom and up the sides of the pan (you want to seal it so the water from the water bath doesn't seep into the pan).  In a large bowl, use an electric mixer to mix the cream cheese- blend until it is nice and smooth and creamy.  Mix in sugar and salt and blend for 2 minutes, scraping down sides of the bowl as needed.  Add eggs, one at a time, blending after each addition.  Finally, mix in sour cream, whipping cream and vanilla.  Mix until smooth.  Pour the batter into the prepared pan.  Set the pan into the roasting pan in the pre-heated oven.  Carefully pour the hot water from your kettle into the roasting pan (it will fill the pan surrounding the cheesecake).  Pour enough water so that there is about an inch of water coming up the foil along the sides of the cheesecake pan.  Bake the cheesecake for 45 minutes.  It should be set to the touch and not jiggly.  Remove the cheesecake from the roasting pan and let it cool on a wire rack for at least an hour.  When it has cooled, place the pan into the freezer and let the cheesecake freeze completely.  This can be done in several hours- or overnight.2.  Prepare the cake layers: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Grease and flour two 9-inch round metal baking pans (or spray with nonstick baking spray with flour).  In a large bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda and salt.  Add eggs, oil, buttermilk, food coloring, vanilla and vinegar to the flour mixture.  Using an electric mixer on medium-low speed, beat for 1 minute, until blended.  Scrape sides and bottom of bowl with a rubber spatula.  Beat on high speed for 2 minutes.  Spread the batter evenly into the prepared pans, dividing equally.  Bake 30 to 35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out with a few moist crumbs attached.  Let cool in pans on a wire rack for 10 minutes.  Run a knife around the edge of the pans, then invert cakes onto a rack to cool completely.3.  Prepare the frosting:  In a large bowl, using an electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat powdered sugar, cream cheese, butter and vanilla until it is smooth and creamy (do not overbeat). 4.  Assemble the cake:  Place one cake layer into the center of a cake plate or platter.  Remove the cheesecake from the freezer, take off the sides of the pan, and slide a knife under the parchment to remove the cheesecake from the pan.  Peel off the parchment.  Measure your cheesecake layer against the cake layers.  If the cheesecake layer turns out to be a slightly larger round than your cake, move it to a cutting board and gently shave off some of the exterior of the cheesecake to get it to the same size as your cake layers.  Place the cheesecake layer on top of the first cake layer.  Place the 2nd cake layer on top of the cheesecake.5.  Frost the cake:  Apply a crumb coat layer to the cake- use a long, thin spatula to cover the cake completely with a thin and even layer of frosting.  Be sure to wipe off your spatula each time you are about to dip it back into the bowl to get more frosting (this way you won't be transferring any red crumbs into the bowl of frosting).  Don't worry at this point about the crumbs being visible in the frosting on the cake.  When your cake has a thin layer of frosting all over it, place it into the refrigerator for 30 minutes to \"set\" the frosting.  Once the first layer of frosting is set, apply the 2nd layer.  Start by adding a large scoop of frosting onto the top of the cake.  Use a long, thin spatula to spread the frosting evenly across the top and then spread it down the sides of the cake too.  Because you applied a crumb-coat layer, you shouldn't have any red crumbs floating around in the final frosting layer.  Decorate, as desired.  I recommend white chocolate shavings (see *Tips below).  Keep this cake refrigerated."

      "instructions": "Put the dough ingredients in the bread machine and set it on the dough setting. (If you don't have a bread machine, see Kakemilla for instructions.)While you're waiting for the dough, make the custard filling: In a saucepan, bring the milk and vanilla almost to a boil over medium heat in a saucepan (little bubbles will be forming on the edges). While the milk is heating, stir together the egg yolks, sugar, flour and corn flour together in a small bowl. Remove the milk from the heat and add 5 tablespoons or so of the hot milk to the bowl, stirring together until fully mixed. Pour this mixture back into the pan of milk and set back on the burner at low heat. Stirring constantly, bring the custard to a boil and allow it to thicken, cooking for at least a minute at full boil. Set the custard aside to cool for at least 30-40 minutes.When the bread dough is done, divide the dough into 12 pieces and, using your hands or a rolling pin, shape each piece into a flattened circle. Add about a Tablespoon or so of the custard to the middle of the circle and bunch the dough up and pinch it together over top of the custard to mostly cover the custard (it's ok if a little of the custard is peeking out the top). Set the buns on a baking sheet lined with a baking mat or sprayed with cooking spray, spray them with cooking spray and let them rise in a warm place for 20 - 30 minutes.Bake at 400 for about 8 - 10 minutes or until the buns are golden brown. Let them cool, then drizzle with a thin glaze (a mix of powdered sugar and water) and sprinkle with coconut."

Add the onions and cook for about 5 minutes, stirring often, until softened and lightly browned. Add garlic, asparagus, salt and pepper, and cook for 2 more minutes, stirring occasionally. Add 2 cups of water and increase heat. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, partially cover, and simmer for 12 minutes, or until asparagus is very tender. Drain the walnuts and transfer to a blender or food processor along with the white beans, miso, lemon juice, and water. Blend until smooth. When the soup is done simmering, turn off heat. Using an immersion blender (or transferring the soup in batches to a blender or food processor) blend until smooth. Stir in pureed white bean mixture and nutmeg.

Spread butter lightly on one side of the flour tortilla shell. Place buttered side of shell down, into a non-stick fry pan that has been preheated on medium heat. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of bacon over entire shell, then add 1 Tbs. Pico de Gallo, and 1/4 cup shredded Colby/Monterey Jack cheese over the bacon. Place the second flour shell on top of fixings, buttered side up. Cook for about one - two minutes just long enough to heat the inside ingredients and then carefully flip the quesadilla on the other side and finish cooking. The quesadilla should be heated through but not browned. Remove quesadilla and place on a serving dish and cut into individual triangle serving pieces. Serve quesadillas with your favorite guacamole sour cream, and Picante sauce.You can find many more copycat restaurant recipes that taste just like  Applebee's Restaurant Recipes here at CopyKat.com."

(Alternatively, use our quick-soak method: see Tip.)Heat oil in a large heavy casserole or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add sausage and bacon and cook, stirring occasionally, until the bacon is almost crisp, 7 to 10 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon to a small bowl and set aside in the refrigerator.Add onions and garlic and cook, stirring, over medium heat, until soft and lightly brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Add bell peppers and chile pepper to taste; continue to cook, stirring, until the mixture is soft, about 3 minutes. Stir in paprika. Add tomatoes and cook until they release their juice, about 2 minutes.Drain the beans. Stir the beans and 8 cups water into the pot; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, for 1 hour. Stir in the reserved sausage and bacon along with salt and pepper. Continue simmering, adding a little water if the beans are dry, until the beans are very soft and beginning to break down, about 30 minutes more. Stir in lime zest and juice."

While the water comes to a boil, set up a bowl of ice water next to the stove.When the water reaches a boil, add the Thai basil leaves and blanch for 20 seconds to set the color and let them wilt. Drain the Thai basil and immediately plunge into the ice water to stop the cooking process. Remove the leaves and squeeze them dry.Put the Thai basil leaves in a blender with the mayonnaise, salt, and ice cube and blend until smooth.For the burgers: Preheat a grill or grill pan over high heat. Cut both meats into cubes and place in a food processor with the salt. Pulse until ground—you want the meat to be chopped but you don’t want it to lose its texture or get tough.Form into 4 patties, make them firm so they don’t fall apart during cooking.Brush the patties on both sides with the glaze. Place over the hottest part of the grill and cook until they release easily from the grill, then turn over, brush with more glaze, and continuing cooking.Cooking time will be about 3 minutes per side for very rare and another minute per side for each increasing stage of doneness. When the burgers are done, brush them again with the glaze.Meanwhile, toast the buns and place each bun open on a plate. Spread the Thai Basil Mayo on both sides of the buns. Then place 1/4 cup shredded lettuce, a few slices of red onion, and a few leaves of Thai basil, cilantro, and mint on the bottom of each bun.Place the grilled burgers on top of the garnishes, drizzle with Sriracha sauce, and top with the other half of the bun to serve."

Poke a bunch of wholes in the skins with a fork and bake at 350 degrees until the squash is very tender, 45-60 minutes.2) Let squash cool for a few minutes and then scoop squash into a large bowl (or food processor bowl)3) Add half and half, nutmeg, cayenne pepper, and 1/2 of the grated cheese and process until smooth. If you don't have a processor you can just mash well to combine everything.4) Cook ziti according to packaging, drain, and combine ziti and butternut squash mixture.5) Butter a 9x13 baking dish very well.6) Add ziti mixture to baking dish and sprinkle on rest of cheese.

Drain and toss with the reserved bacon fat.Melt the butter in a saucepan and stir in the flour.  Cook for about a minute, and then slowly pour in the milk, stirring or whisking constantly to combine all the flour into the milk.  Continue heating and stirring until the mixture thickens, this will happen just as the milk is getting to the boiling point.  Take the pan off the heat and add the cheese, a little at a time, stirring to melt.  Add the cooked pasta and half the bacon crumbles to the sauce, tossing to combine well.  Divide the mixture between 4 oven safe bowls. Make an indentation in the center of each bowl with the back of a large spoon for the egg.  Crack an egg into each .  Put the bowls on a baking sheet and bake until the eggs are just set, about 20 minutes or so, depending on how you like our egg done.  Turn up the heat to 400F if your egg is slow to set.Grind some fresh black pepper over each bowl, and scatter the rest of the crumbled bacon around the egg just before serving."

Sprinkle molds evenly with 2 tablespoons granulated sugar, shaking out excess. (If you only have one pan, bake the recipe in 2 batches.)Whisk together flour, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a mixing bowl. Whisk egg and egg white in another bowl until frothy. Add brown sugar and the remaining 1/2 cup granulated sugar; whisk until smooth. Add yogurt (or buttermilk), oil and vanilla and whisk until blended. Add the dry ingredients and stir with a rubber spatula just until moistened.Spoon about 2 tablespoons of batter into each prepared mold, smoothing the surfaces with a small spoon. Bake until the tops spring back when touched lightly, 8 to 10 minutes. Loosen edges and turn the doughnuts out onto a wire rack to cool. (If baking in 2 batches, cool the pan, clean it, then recoat it with cooking spray or oil and sugar.)To make glaze: Whisk confectioners sugar, vanilla and enough of the milk to make a smooth, thick glaze. When the doughnuts are completely cool, set them, fluted-side up, on a wire rack over wax paper. Spoon some glaze over each doughnut, letting it drip down the sides. (Alternatively, dip the doughnuts in glaze.) Let stand until glaze has set."

      "instructions": "1 Preheat the oven to 400°F.  Heat the butter or oil in a large sauté pan on medium high heat.  Pat dry the chops with paper towels. Lightly salt the pork chops then brown each side in the sauté pan.  Cook just enough to brown, then remove from pan and place into a high-sided baking dish or roasting pan.  (If your pork chops are very thin and have cooked through at this point, skip the oven step and tent them loosely with aluminum foil while making the sauce.)2 Add the minced onion to the sauté pan in which you browned the pork, and sauté for 2-3 minutes, until the onion begins to brown. Add the vinegar, chili powder, pepper, maple syrup, water, and Worcestershire sauce to the pan and bring to a boil. Pour this sauce over the pork chops in the baking dish. Lower the heat to 350°F and bake uncovered for 10-15 minutes for thick (1-inch thick) chops, 5-10 minutes for thin (1/2-inch thick) chops, or until the interior of the pork reaches 145°F.3 Optional In the same sauté pan that you used to make the sauce, add a little oil and heat to medium high.  Cook the sliced onions in the pan, allowing the onions to pick up any sauce remaining in the pan.  Cook until lightly browned, while the pork chops are baking.4 Place the pork chops on a serving platter and loosely tent with foil. Pour the sauce into the saucepan you seared the chops in and whisk in 1 tablespoon flour to thicken the gravy. Salt to taste, and serve the gravy over the chops and (optional) onions."

Add the green onions and cook 1 minute more.3 Pour in the milk or cream, mix well, and add the potatoes. Reduce the heat to medium.  Use a fork or potato masher and mash the potatoes, mixing them up with the greens. Add salt to taste and serve hot, with a knob of butter in the center."

Gently spoon the cheesecake onto the brownie batter. Bake at 350* for 45-50 minutes. Let cool completely. Cut into 24 squares.In a small saucepan heat the caramel bits and whipping cream until melted. Drizzle with a spoon over cheesecake squares.
