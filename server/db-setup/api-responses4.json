I put the spice paste and chicken in a Ziploc bag. Marinate in the fridge for at least one hour. Marinating chicken overnight always improves the flavor and tenderization.Preheat the grill to medium-low heat. Slowly grill the chicken, turning often until cooked through and golden brown all over. Alternatively you can rotisserie, bake, or broil this chicken until cooked through to an internal temperature of 165F (75C). We have a gas grill, but we also like cooking on a grill over charcoal so the flavor is good.For Thai Sweet Chili Sauce, combine all the ingredients in a small saucepan and bring to a boil.Boil over medium heat for 10 minutes or until the mixture has reduced to 1 cup (250ml). It might be still runny and not syrupy, but it will thicken further as it cools.Remove from the heat and cool to room temperature before storing in the refrigerator for up to a few months.Serve with wedges of cucumber to snack on and a bowl of Thai Sweet Chili Sauce for dipping."},{"vegetarian":false,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":false,"dairyFree":false,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":false,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":7,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":false,"servings":12,"preparationMinutes":15,"cookingMinutes":2,"sourceUrl":"http://www.creative-culinary.com/blue-cheese-walnut-port-wine-pate/","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/blue-cheese-walnut-and-port-wine-pt-693693","aggregateLikes":149,"creditText":"Creative Culinary","sourceName":"Creative Culinary","extendedIngredients":[{"id":1004,"aisle":"Cheese","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/blue-cheese.png","name":"blue cheese","amount":1,"unit":"pound","unitShort":"lb","unitLong":"pound","originalString":"One-half pound Blue Cheese, room temperature","metaInformation":["room temperature"]},{"id":1001,"aisle":"Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg","name":"butter","amount":2,"unit":"Tablespoons","unitShort":"Tablespoons","unitLong":"Tablespoons","originalString":"2 Tablespoons Butter, softened","metaInformation":["softened"]},{"id":1017,"aisle":"Cheese","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cream-cheese.jpg","name":"cream cheese","amount":2,"unit":"Tablespoons","unitShort":"Tablespoons","unitLong":"Tablespoons","originalString":"2 Tablespoons Cream Cheese, softened","metaInformation":["softened"]},{"id":18621,"aisle":"Savory Snacks","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/crackers.jpg","name":"melba toast","amount":1,"unit":"slices","unitShort":"slices","unitLong":"slice","originalString":"Toasted baguette slices or Melba Toast","metaInformation":["toasted"]},{"id":10114057,"aisle":"Alcoholic Beverages","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/red-wine.jpg","name":"port wine","amount":3,"unit":"Tbsp","unitShort":"Tbsp","unitLong":"Tbsps","originalString":"3 Tbsp Port Wine","metaInformation":[]},{"id":12155,"aisle":"Nuts","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/walnuts.jpg","name":"walnuts","amount":0.5,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"½ cup Toasted Walnuts, divided","metaInformation":["divided","toasted"]}],"id":693693,"title":"Blue Cheese, Walnut, and Port Wine Pâté","readyInMinutes":17,"image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/blue-cheese-walnut-and-port-wine-pt-693693.jpg","imageType":"jpg","cuisines":[],"instructions":"Combine the butter, blue cheese and cream cheese in the bowl of a stand mixer.

There is no need to cook them all the way through. Pat off excess oil with a paper towel. Set aside to cool. Once cooled slice width wise into about 1/3-inch circles. If you wish to add meatballs this would be the time to make and brown them and set them aside as well.Heat your stock pot. Once heated add olive oil.Add onion and garlic and sauté until onions are transparent.Add sliced all meat, including sausage, and cook until meat is no longer read on outside.Add mushrooms, parsley, Italian seasoning and wine; cover; and sauté 10 minutes more.While the mixture is sautéing, empty whole tomatoes into a bowl with 2 knives cut up into small pieces or pulsate in a food processor. You want to leave the tomatoes a little chunky. You use can also use diced canned tomatoesOnce the meat mixture has completed the 10 minutes of sautéing, add the chopped tomatoes, tomato sauce and tomato paste into the meat mixture pot. You can use some hot water to get the last bit out of the cans by scraping the sides of the can with a spoon. If you use about a half to a whole can of water for each can of tomato sauce and paste you will have enough water in your sauce.Add sugar, stir. Add meatballs, if you desire. Let simmer for at least 3 hours. The longer it cooks the better it will taste.As the sauce becomes too thick add additional water to taste. Some like it really thick and others like it saucy.Freeze leftovers in several air tight containers. I like to freeze several different sizes, for individual meals, family meals and for company."},{"vegetarian":false,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":false,"dairyFree":false,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":false,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":26,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":false,"servings":8,"preparationMinutes":40,"cookingMinutes":40,"sourceUrl":"http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchens/chocolate-almond-torte-recipe.html","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/chocolate-almond-torte-320755","aggregateLikes":14,"creditText":"Foodnetwork","sourceName":"Foodnetwork","extendedIngredients":[{"id":19903,"aisle":"Sweet Snacks","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/dark-chocolate-pieces.jpg","name":"bittersweet chocolate","amount":8,"unit":"ounces","unitShort":"oz","unitLong":"ounces","originalString":"8 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped","metaInformation":["chopped"]},{"id":12062,"aisle":"Nuts","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/almonds-(sliced).jpg","name":"blanched almonds","amount":1.25,"unit":"cups","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"1 1/4 cups blanched, sliced almonds","metaInformation":["sliced"]},{"id":18079,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/breadcrumbs.jpg","name":"breadcrumbs","amount":2,"unit":"tablespoons","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoons","originalString":"2 tablespoons breadcrumbs","metaInformation":[]},{"id":1001,"aisle":"Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg","name":"butter","amount":12,"unit":"tablespoons","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoons","originalString":"12 tablespoons unsalted butter, diced, plus more for greasing","metaInformation":["unsalted","diced","plus more for greasing"]},{"id":19336,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/powdered-sugar.jpg","name":"confectioners' sugar","amount":8,"unit":"servings","unitShort":"servings","unitLong":"servings","originalString":"Confectioners' sugar, for garnish","metaInformation":["for garnish"]},{"id":14037,"aisle":"Alcoholic Beverages","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/rum-dark.jpg","name":"dark rum","amount":1,"unit":"tablespoon","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoon","originalString":"1 tablespoon dark rum","metaInformation":["dark"]},{"id":1123,"aisle":"Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg","name":"eggs","amount":3,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"3 large eggs, separated, plus 3 egg yolks","metaInformation":["separated","large"]},{"id":19335,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg","name":"granulated sugar","amount":0.75,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"3/4 cup granulated sugar","metaInformation":[]},{"id":9216,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/zest-orange.jpg","name":"orange zest","amount":1,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"Grated zest of 1 orange","metaInformation":["grated"]},{"id":2047,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg","name":"salt","amount":0.5,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"1/2 teaspoon salt","metaInformation":[]}],"id":320755,"title":"Chocolate-Almond Torte","readyInMinutes":80,"image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/chocolate-almond-torte-320755.jpeg","imageType":"jpeg","cuisines":[],"instructions":"Directions                                                        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Toast the almonds on a baking sheet until lightly golden, 6 to 7 minutes. Cool slightly, then pulse in a food processor until finely ground, but not pasty.Melt 12 tablespoons butter and the chocolate in a heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water (do not let the bowl touch the water). Stir until the chocolate is smooth, then remove from the heat and cool slightly. Grease the bottom and sides of a 9-inch springform pan with butter and coat with the breadcrumbs, tapping out the excess.Set aside 2 tablespoons granulated sugar. Combine the 6 egg yolks and the remaining sugar in a stand mixer and beat with the paddle attachment on medium-high until thick and pale, about 3 minutes. Add the orange zest, rum and salt, then beat in the melted chocolate until smooth. Mix in the ground almonds until just combined.In a clean bowl, beat the 3 egg whites with a mixer until foamy. Gradually beat in the reserved 2 tablespoons granulated sugar on high speed until almost stiff. Stir one-third of the whites into the chocolate batter, then gently fold in the rest. Spread the batter in the prepared pan and bake until the top is firm and cracked (a toothpick inserted into the cake will be fudgy), 35 to 40 minutes. Cool on a rack 10 minutes, then run a knife around the edge of the pan and remove the ring. Serve warm or at room temperature. Garnish with confectioners' sugar and whipped cream, if desired.Photograph by Con Poulos                                                    Recipe courtesy of Food Network Magazine

degrees F.Rinse the quinoa in a fine sieve, then drain excess water. Place the drained quinoa in a frying pan over medium heat. It will take the water a few minute to evaporate, then as the quinoa dries, it will begin to toast. Stir periodically until the quinoa is evenly browned and gives off a lovely nutty aroma. Set aside 1/4 cup of the toasted quinoa.Place the remaining 3/4 cup quinoa and 1 cup water in a saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat. Lower the heat to a simmer, and cook for about 10 minutes. Cover and let the quinoa sit for 5 minutes more. The water should be fully absorbed. Drain any excess water if necessary.While the quinoa cooks and cools, prepare the artichokes. Fill a large bowl with cool water, then squeeze the juice of two lemons into the water, and drop the lemons into water, as well. Remove the outer leaves of the artichoke by snapping them off, until you are left with the tender leaves within. Cut about 1 1/2 inches off the tops of the artichoke, then remove the purple choke inside by scooping it out with a spoon. Trim the stems of the artichoke, then peel the tough outer layer of the stem. Place the artichokes in the lemon water bath. Repeat with remaining artichokes.In a medium bowl, combine the cooked quinoa, feta, parmesan, garlic, shallot, cilantro and parsley. Stir in the olive oil and toss to evenly coat the stuffing.

Place in a draft-free area to rise at warm room temperature until doubled in size, about 30 minutes.In a small bowl, mix together brown sugar, cinnamon, cardamom, allspice, cloves and ginger. Set aside.Grease the bottom and sides of an 8x8 cake pan with butter. Set aside.Roll dough on a lightly floured work surface to 9x12-inch rectangle. Spread softened butter over rolled dough and sprinkle with brown sugar mixture. Starting from one of the short sides, roll the dough up and pinch seam to seal.Using a sharp knife, cut the dough into 9 equal pieces. Place the rolls into the prepared pan and cover with plastic wrap or a clean dish towel. Place in a draft-free place to rise at warm room temperature until once again doubled, about 30 minutes.While dough rises, preheat oven to 375F. Once rolls have risen, bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes, or until golden brown.While rolls bake, whisk together powdered sugar and milk until no lumps remain. If too thick, add a little bit more milk until desired consistency is reached. It should be a spreadable, thick consistency.Serve warm."},{"vegetarian":true,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":false,"dairyFree":true,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":false,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":7,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":false,"servings":6,"preparationMinutes":10,"cookingMinutes":20,"sourceUrl":"http://www.bakedbyrachel.com/applesauce-carrot-cake-muffins/","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/applesauce-carrot-cake-muffins-709115","aggregateLikes":94,"creditText":"Baked by Rachel","sourceName":"Baked by Rachel","extendedIngredients":[{"id":20081,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png","name":"all purpose flour","amount":1,"unit":"C","unitShort":"C","unitLong":"C","originalString":"1C all purpose flour","metaInformation":[]},{"id":9019,"aisle":"Canned and Jarred","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/applesauce.jpg","name":"applesauce","amount":0.25,"unit":"C","unitShort":"C","unitLong":"Cs","originalString":"1/4C applesauce","metaInformation":[]},{"id":18371,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg","name":"baking powder","amount":1.5,"unit":"tsp","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"1 1/2 tsp baking powder","metaInformation":[]},{"id":11124,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/carrots.jpg","name":"carrots","amount":0.75,"unit":"C","unitShort":"C","unitLong":"Cs","originalString":"3/4C carrots, finely shredded","metaInformation":["shredded","finely"]},{"id":2010,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cinnamon.jpg","name":"cinnamon","amount":1,"unit":"tsp","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoon","originalString":"1 tsp cinnamon","metaInformation":[]},{"id":19335,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg","name":"granulated sugar","amount":0.25,"unit":"C","unitShort":"C","unitLong":"Cs","originalString":"1/4C granulated sugar","metaInformation":[]},{"id":2011,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cloves.jpg","name":"ground cloves","amount":1,"unit":"pinch","unitShort":"pinch","unitLong":"pinch","originalString":"Pinch ground cloves","metaInformation":[]},{"id":19334,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-sugar-dark.jpg","name":"light brown sugar","amount":0.25,"unit":"C","unitShort":"C","unitLong":"Cs","originalString":"1/4C light brown sugar","metaInformation":["light"]},{"id":2025,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ground-nutmeg.jpg","name":"nutmeg","amount":0.25,"unit":"tsp","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"1/4 tsp nutmeg","metaInformation":[]},{"id":2047,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg","name":"salt","amount":0.25,"unit":"tsp","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"1/4 tsp salt","metaInformation":[]},{"id":2050,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla-extract.jpg","name":"vanilla extract","amount":1,"unit":"tsp","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoon","originalString":"1 tsp vanilla extract","metaInformation":[]},{"id":4513,"aisle":"Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vegetable-oil.jpg","name":"vegetable oil","amount":0.5,"unit":"Tb","unitShort":"Tb","unitLong":"Tbs","originalString":"1/2Tb vegetable oil","metaInformation":[]},{"id":1123,"aisle":"Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg","name":"whole egg","amount":1,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"1 whole egg","metaInformation":["whole"]}],"id":709115,"title":"Applesauce Carrot Cake Muffins","readyInMinutes":30,"image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/applesauce-carrot-cake-muffins-709115.jpg","imageType":"jpg","cuisines":[],"instructions":"Preheat oven to 350F.

parsnip pure:  Bring 1 quart of water to a boil on the stove in a large saucepot, add parsnips and boil until parsnips are well cooked and fall apart easily (about 30 minutes) Strain and reserve cooking liquid for the tomato broth, then add hot parsnips, butter and cream to a blender and blend on high until smooth, adding some additional cooking liquid if needed until desired consistency is reached. Season with salt and pepper and set aside until ready to serve.  For the tomato broth:  Slice tomatoes in half and toss with olive oil and chopped garlic in a mixing bowl. Place in a small baking dish and roast in a 350F oven until soft but not mushy. Rough chop and set aside. In a saucepan, combine the cooked chopped tomatoes and 2 cups of the reserved parsnip cooking liquid. Reduce down until it thickens slightly. Add salt and pepper to taste.  For the meatballs:  Begin by roasting the beets. Preheat oven to 350F and rinse the outside of the beets to remove any dirt or debris that may be on them. Place them in a small baking dish with a little water on the bottom and cover with foil the water will prevent the beets from scorching. Roast in the oven for about 1 hour, or until a fork inserted can be removed easily. Remove beets from dish and place in the refrigerator to cool. Once cooled, use a dish rag or strong paper towel and wipe the skin on the outside of the beets. It will come off easily. Grate the skinned beets on a fine cheese grater and reserve until later. Spread out cooked rice on a cookie sheet or large plate and allow to cool to room temperature. In a large saut pan over medium-high heat, saut the onions, celery and carrots for 5 minutes, stirring constantly. Add the mushrooms and cook an additional 4 minutes or so. Season liberally with salt and black pepper and then add the cooled shredded beets and toss to combine. Allow this mixture to cool to room temperature as well by spreading on a cookie sheet or large plate. Once everything has cooled, combine all ingredients excluding the eggs in a large mixing bowl and check seasonings, then add eggs. Roll mixture into 2-ounce balls and place in a dish close together, flattening the bottom a little so they do not roll around. Roast at 350F for 20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean. Serve the meatballs over the parsnip pure with a little parsnip and tomato broth on top.

For the meat mixture: Combine the ground beef, breadcrumbs, ketchup, dry mustard, Worcestershire sauce, bouillon and some salt and pepper. Knead until all combined. Form into 4 to 6 oval patties, and then make lines across the patties to give them a \"steak\" appearance.Fry the patties in a skillet with the butter and oil over medium-high heat on both sides until no longer pink in the middle. Remove from the skillet and pour off any excess grease.For the gravy: Reduce the heat to medium and add in the sliced onions. Stir and cook until golden brown and somewhat soft, for several minutes. Add the beef stock, ketchup, seasoning sauce, if using, and the Worcestershire. Then combine the cornstarch with a little beef broth and add to the sauce if using. Stir and cook to reduce.Add a sprinkle of salt and pepper and more broth if needed for thinning. Then return the patties to the gravy. Spoon the gravy over the top and let them simmer and heat back up for a couple of minutes.                                                    2012 Ree Drummond, All Rights Reserved                         CATEGORIES:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Beef                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Main Dish                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Steak                                                                                                                                        View All         <div class=\"popover-content categories\">                        <ul>                    <li>Main Ingredient</li>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <li class=\"last\"><a href=\"/content/food/topics/b/beef-tenderloin-recipes.html\">Beef</a></li>                                 </ul>                <ul>                    <li>Course</li>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <li class=\"last\"><a href=\"/content/food/topics/m/main-dish.html\">Main Dish</a></li>                                 </ul>                <ul>                    <li>Dish</li>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <li class=\"last\"><a href=\"/content/food/topics/s/steak.html\">Steak</a></li>                                 </ul></div>"},{"vegetarian":true,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":true,"dairyFree":false,"veryHealthy":true,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":false,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":5,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":false,"servings":2,"preparationMinutes":10,"cookingMinutes":25,"sourceUrl":"http://www.london-unattached.com/2014/01/5-2-diet-fast-recipes-mushroom-stroganoff/","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/healthy-for-the-5-2-diet-fast-days-mushroom-stroganoff-666721","aggregateLikes":138,"extendedIngredients":[{"id":1001056,"aisle":"Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sour-cream.jpg","name":"creme fraiche","amount":30,"unit":"ml","unitShort":"ml","unitLong":"milliliters","originalString":"30ml Low Fat Creme Fraiche","metaInformation":["low fat"]},{"id":11297,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/parsley.jpg","name":"fresh flat leaf parsley","amount":1,"unit":"handful","unitShort":"handful","unitLong":"handful","originalString":"1 handful Flat Leaf Parsley","metaInformation":[]},{"id":11260,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/mushrooms.jpg","name":"mushrooms","amount":400,"unit":"g","unitShort":"g","unitLong":"grams","originalString":"400g Mushrooms (Sliced -

                                                       For the clove-scented ketchup: Whisk together the ketchup and clove in a small bowl. Cover and let sit at room temperature.For the Home Fries: Heat the butter in a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat until it begins to shimmer. Add the potatoes, za'atar, paprika, turmeric and a very generous amount of salt and toss to coat the potatoes. Use a spatula to press and crush the potatoes against the bottom of the pan. Cook until golden brown and crisp on the bottom, about 4 minutes. Turn in large chunks and press again to crisp. Cook until browned on the bottom, another 4 minutes. Taste and add salt as needed.While the potatoes crisp, heat the vegetable oil in a small skillet over medium heat. Add the chiles and cook, stirring, until warmed and very slightly softened, about 1 minute. Stir in the herbs.Spoon the chile mixture over the potatoes and drizzle with the lime juice. Serve straight from the pan, with the clove-scented ketchup on the side.

Measure the flour into a large bowl; set aside. Combine the water, olive oil, yeast, sugar and salt in a large, 4-cup measuring cup or in a small bowl, mixing to dissolve the yeast. Pour the water mixture over the flour and mix with a wooden spoon until all of the flour is moistened. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for a minute or two, adding additional flour or water if the dough it is too sticky or dry, until soft and just slightly tacky. Place the dough in a well-oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and place in a draft-free area until doubled in size (this can take anywhere from 1 to 3 hours).2. Line three baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats and set aside. Working on a pastry mat or clean counter or table, oil the surface, your hands and a rolling pin. Divide the dough into two. Take the first half and gently press down on it, flipping it over and doing the same, to release gasses and flatten it. Using the rolling pin or your hands, shape the dough into a rectangle measuring about 5 inches by 16 inches, and ½-inch thick. Using a pizza cutter, slice the rectangle into 5-inch by ¾-inch strips.3. Sprinkle the strips with flour. Taking the strips one at a time, gently roll it back and forth to create an even rope. Tie it into a knot and place on a prepared baking sheet. Place the knots about 1½ inches apart. Continue to make the rest of the knots and repeat process with the second piece of dough. Cover the baking sheets with a dry kitchen towel or cheesecloth and place in a warm, draft-free area to rise. The rolls should double in size during the second rise.4. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.5. Once the knots have doubled in size, remove the towel covering them and bake, one pan at a time, for 12 to 15 minutes, or until golden.6. While the knots are baking, prepare the garlic coating. Over low heat, warm the olive oil, butter and garlic in a small saucepan. Add the chopped parsley, cover and set aside.7.

half through the root and trim off the top. Place the onion,cut-side down, on a chopping board. With your knife parallelto the board, cut 3 slices through the onion, keeping the rootintact. With knife point at root end, cut down through the onion,from top to bottom 4 times. Holding the root end, finely sliceacross the onion (see pic above), to give you small diced pieces.Set a large frying pan over medium heat andwhen hot, tip in the oil then onion. Cook for 5 mins untilstarting to soften, stirring occasionally. Add the garlic, cook2 mins more until the onions start to turn golden. When theonion has softened, tip in the tomatoes and half the basil.Leave to gently bubble for 15 mins until the sauce hasthickened and looks pulpy. Stir occasionally and break up anylarge clumps of tomato with the back of your spoon.Pour water ¾ of the way up your largest pan.Heat over a high heat and add plenty of salt. When water hasreached a rolling boil, place the spaghetti into the pan. As itsoftens, use your hands to push all of it into the water. Give ita stir to separate the pasta, then cook according to packinstructions, about 10 mins. Taste a strand of pasta. It shouldbe just soft, but not mushy. Scoop out a cup of water beforedraining in a colander (this will help to loosen your sauce).Finishing touches: Tip the drained pasta back into its cookingpan, then pour over the tomato sauce. Give everything a goodstir. The sauce should just coat the pasta, if it is thick and looksdry, stir in a few spoons of the pasta water. If it is watery, cookover a low heat until evaporated, stirring often. Use your handsto break the mozzarella into chunky pieces and stir through thepasta along with the remaining basil leaves.

                                                                                  2                                                                            Cover the mixture and store in the fridge

Add the chorizo and fry briskly for about 10 minutes, until crisp and cooked through. If you’re using the soft Tupperware chorizo, you can start with a bit of a lump and break it up with a spatula as it fries, so it forms lots of succulent little nuggets and crumbs, thereby maximizing the surface area available for crisping.                                                                                                                            5                                                                            Beat the egg yolks and cream together and season lightly (since the chorizo is already highly seasoned).                                                                                                                            6                                                                            When the pasta is done, drain thoroughly and immediately return it to the hot pan. Tip in the crisp chorizo, followed by the egg mixture. Use 2 forks to mix the eggy cream into the hot pasta. It will cook in the heat of the pasta, coating each strand in a light, creamy sauce. Serve right away, with a final grinding of black pepper on top."},{"vegetarian":false,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":true,"dairyFree":true,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":false,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":8,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":false,"servings":4,"sourceUrl":"http://www.confessionsofanover-workedmom.com/2012/11/mongolian-beef-recipe.html","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/mongolian-beef-482262","aggregateLikes":205,"creditText":"Confessions of an Over Worked Mom","sourceName":"Confessions of an Over Worked Mom","extendedIngredients":[{"id":23572,"aisle":"Frozen","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/beef-cubes-raw.png","name":"beef","amount":8,"unit":"oz","unitShort":"oz","unitLong":"ounces","originalString":"8 oz beef sliced into thin strips","metaInformation":["sliced into thin strips"]},{"id":4582,"aisle":"Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vegetable-oil.jpg","name":"cooking oil","amount":2,"unit":"tablespoons","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoons","originalString":"2 tablespoons cooking oil","metaInformation":[]},{"id":20027,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg","name":"corn starch","amount":1,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoon","originalString":"1 teaspoon corn starch","metaInformation":[]},{"id":11216,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ginger.jpg","name":"fresh ginger","amount":0.5,"unit":"tbsp","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoons","originalString":"½ tbsp chopped fresh ginger","metaInformation":["fresh","chopped"]},{"id":11215,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg","name":"garlic","amount":3,"unit":"cloves","unitShort":"cloves","unitLong":"cloves","originalString":"3 cloves garlic, sliced or chopped thinly","metaInformation":["sliced","chopped"]},{"id":10216124,"aisle":"Condiments","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/soy-sauce.jpg","name":"light soy sauce","amount":1,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoon","originalString":"1 teaspoon light soy sauce","metaInformation":["light"]},{"id":11282,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-onion.jpg","name":"onion","amount":1,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"1 small onion sliced in strips or use leeks or scallions if you prefer","metaInformation":["small","sliced in strips or use leeks or scallions if you prefer"]},{"id":2047,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg","name":"salt","amount":4,"unit":"servings","unitShort":"servings","unitLong":"servings","originalString":"Salt to taste","metaInformation":["to taste"]},{"id":4058,"aisle":"Ethnic Foods","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sesame-oil.jpg","name":"sesame oil","amount":0.25,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"¼ teaspoon sesame oil","metaInformation":[]},{"id":16124,"aisle":"Ethnic Foods","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/soy-sauce.jpg","name":"soy sauce","amount":2,"unit":"tablespoons","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoons","originalString":"2 tablespoons soy sauce","metaInformation":[]},{"id":11583,"aisle":"Frozen","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/mixed-vegetables.png","name":"stir fry vegetables","amount":1,"unit":"bag","unitShort":"bag","unitLong":"bag","originalString":"1 bag of stir fry vegetables","metaInformation":[]},{"id":19335,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg","name":"sugar","amount":1,"unit":"tablespoon","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoon","originalString":"1 tablespoon sugar or to taste","metaInformation":["to taste"]},{"id":14412,"aisle":"Beverages","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/water.jpg","name":"water","amount":1,"unit":"tablespoon","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoon","originalString":"1 tablespoon water","metaInformation":[]}],"id":482262,"title":"Mongolian Beef","readyInMinutes":45,"image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Mongolian-Beef-482262.jpg","imageType":"jpg","cuisines":[],"instructions":"Marinate the beef with the seasonings for 30 minutes.

Sauce","readyInMinutes":45,"image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/BBQ-Turkey-with-Mustard-Sauce-246523.jpg","imageType":"jpg","cuisines":["american"],"instructions":"1 Pat the turkey pieces dry with paper towels.  Salt the turkey pieces well all over.  Let sit at room temperature for 20-30 minutes.2 Make the sauce.  Sauté the onions in butter until soft (but not browned), about 3-4 minutes on medium heat.  Add the other sauce ingredients and simmer slowly, stirring occasionally, for at least 30 minutes. 3 Prepare your grill for high direct heat on one side, and quite low indirect heat on the other side. To do this using a gas grill turn on only half of the burners.  If using a charcoal grill, leave one side of your grill free of coals.  If using a gas grill, preheat covered for at least 15 minutes.3 Rub oil all over the turkey pieces.  Clean the grill grates with a grill grate scraper. Wipe down the grates with a paper towel soaked in oil.  4 Lay the turkey pieces down on the hot grill, skin side down, to get an initial sear on the turkey.  Pay attention because the fat in the turkey may cause flare ups.  If this happens be prepared to move the piece to a cooler side of the grill temporarily, or have a spay bottle of water on hand to douse the flames a bit if they get too high.  Sear the turkey on the skin side for 3-4 minutes.  Once the skin of a piece starts to get browned, move the piece to the cool side of the grill, turning it over so that the skin side is now up.  This way the fat under the skin will melt into the meat, basting it, during the next slow-cooking phase.5 Once you've moved all the turkey to the cool side of the grill, cover the grill and let the turkey slow-cook for 20 minutes without looking. Check every 15-20 minutes after that, because everyone’s grill is different.  The turkey should cook for at least 1 1/2 hours after the initial sear, probably longer. (I think we cooked these  pictured for 2 1/2 hours.) Barbecue by definition must be slow cooking over low heat.6 After about an hour, start to paint the turkey with the barbecue sauce.  Paint only the top part (skin side) to start.  Cover and wait another 20 minutes or so. Then flip the turkey over and paint the undersides.  Why wait? You want the sauce to sink in, adhere to the turkey and solidify a little; this way it will not drip down into the grill as much.  Cover and wait another 15 to 20 minutes.Depending on how big your turkey pieces are, and your specific grill set up, the time it takes for your turkey pieces to be done will vary.  To test for doneness you can insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the thigh, not touching the bone.  Take the turkey off the grill at 170°F to 175°F for thighs and legs, 165°F for breasts.  Or if you don't have a meat thermometer, cut into one of the pieces with a knife. The juices should run clear.  If they run pink, the meat needs to be cooked longer.You can continue to baste with the sauce every 15 minutes or so until the meat is done.7 When the meat is just about ready to take off the grill, you can do a final sear on the skin side.  Just place the pieces skin side down on the hot part of the grill.  Watch it so that it just browns, not burns.  It should take 1-2 minutes.Serve with extra sauce, and plenty of napkins!"},{"vegetarian":false,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":true,"dairyFree":true,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":false,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":3,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":false,"servings":8,"sourceUrl":"http://www.slowcookeradventures.com/2012/07/margarita-chicken.html","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/margarita-chicken-615109","aggregateLikes":20,"extendedIngredients":[{"id":1002014,"aisle":"Spices

and add the butter to a large saucepan over medium high heat.  When the butter is melted add the onion and cook until soft, about 5 minutes.3) Dice the celery, carrots, and hot pepper and add those to the onions along with the cobs from the corn.  Add a pinch of salt and stir.4) Cook for another few minutes until the carrots and celery are soft.5) Turn the heat down to low/medium-low.6) Add the cream, milk, and bay leaves and bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally.  Make sure the dairy isn't burning to the pan at all.  It should take 15 minutes or so to come to a simmer.7) Simmer for 30 minutes.  Depending on how thick you want your soup, you can take the lid off the pot during this.  I simmered for 20 minutes with lid on and 10 minutes with lid off.8) Remove cobs and bay leaf, and add diced potatoes and cook for another 5 minutes until potatoes are soft.9) Add corn, diced peppers, thyme, and taste for salt and pepper.  Simmer for another minute or so and serve immediately.  The

Place your egg whites and salt in a very clean glass or metal bowl. In a small bowl, mix together your cornstarch and sugar. In another small bowl, mix together your vinegar and vanilla. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Now we're ready to get whipping.Using the wire whisks of your stand mixer or electric hand mixer, begin beating your egg white and salt mixture on a low speed, steadily increasing up to medium high. The whites will get frothy and then turn to soft peaks. (The egg whites have reached soft peaks when you can turn off your mixer and lift the beaters out of the fluffy egg whites and you get peaks that fold back down on themselves.)Once the egg whites have reached soft peaks, start adding your sugar and cornstarch mixture, slowly (about 1-2 Tbsp at a time), while beating on medium high speed. Once all the sugar has been added, continue beating until the egg whites hold stiff peaks, this could take up to 5 minutes. (You've reached stiff peaks when you can turn off your mixer and lift the beaters out of the egg whites and you get peaks that stand at attention and don't fold over.)Add the vinegar and vanilla mixture to the egg whites and beat for another 20-30 seconds, just until they are fully incorporated.Scoop the meringue onto the parchment lined baking sheet, using roughly  c for each mini pavlova. Gently shape the meringues into nests, with a slight indentation in the middle, leaving roughly 1 inch space between them. (The meringues will grow slightly in the oven.)Put the meringue in the oven and bake for 45-55 min. The pavlova are done when the outside shell is starting to firm up and get dry to the touch (not tacky) and they are just starting to get lightly golden. (The shell will continue to dry out, but only a little, as they cool.)Turn off the oven, leaving the pavlova inside. (This will allow the pavlova to cool slowly, keeping them from falling due to drastic temperature shifts.) Leave the pavlova in the oven 1-2 hours, or until cooled. (They can be left in the oven overnight as long as your house isnt humid.)To store the pavlova shells, place them in an airtight container on the counter. They will keep this way for several days.Just before serving, top the pavlovas with whipped cream and fresh fruit."},{"vegetarian":false,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":true,"dairyFree":false,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":false,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":18,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":true,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":false,"servings":8,"sourceUrl":"http://www.food52.com/recipes/2881_cardamon_orange_flourless_chocolate_cake","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/cardamon-orange-flourless-chocolate-cake-60507","aggregateLikes":18,"extendedIngredients":[{"id":19903,"aisle":"Sweet

cauliflower: Preheat oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit. Toss cauliflower florets with enough olive oil to cover them in a light, even layer of oil. Season with salt and pepper and arrange the florets in a single layer on a large, rimmed baking sheet. Roast for 30 to 35 minutes, tossing halfway, until the florets are deeply golden on the edges.To cook the freekeh: Warm 1 tablespoon olive oil in a heavy-bottomed saucepan. Add the almonds and cook, stirring occasionally, until it's fragrant and turning golden on the edges, about 3 minutes. Add the freekeh and saut for 2 minutes, then add the garlic, cumin, coriander and salt, and saut for 1 more minute. Add vegetable broth, raise the heat and bring the mixture a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover and cook, stirring occasionally and reducing heat as necessary to maintain a gentle simmer, until freekeh is tender to the bite, 20 to 25 minutes. Drain off any excess liquid, cover and set aside for 5 minutes. Fluff with a fork and season with salt and pepper to taste.To make the dressing: In a bowl, stir together the tahini, lemon juice, garlic and red pepper flakes. Whisk in the water until you have a smooth, blended tahini sauce. Season generously with salt and black pepper, to taste.To assemble the individual dishes: Start with a bed of cooked freekeh and top with roasted cauliflower. Drizzle tahini sauce generously over the dish and then top with a sprinkling of chopped fresh herbs, crumbled feta (optional), raisins and sesame seeds. Serve immediately.
