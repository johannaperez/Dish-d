In a medium mixing bowl, beat the eggs with milk, 1/4 tsp pepper and 1/2 tsp salt till fluffy (if salt sensitive use 1/4 tsp salt). Reserve.Harissas vary in thickness/pastiness. If your harissa is a thicker, drier paste, stir in a little olive oil till it becomes more liquid and easier to spread. Reserve.Heat olive oil in skillet on medium high till hot but not smoking. Add the sliced mushrooms in a single layer. Let them sear for 3-4 minutes without stirring till golden on the bottom. Stir the mushrooms, then stir in 1-2 tbsp of harissa to taste. I used about 1 1/2 tbsp-- you may need more or less depending on the spiciness of your harissa. The mushrooms should be spicy and well seasoned, but not too spicy to handle. Stir till the mushrooms are golden brown and coated with harissa.Stir in minced garlic and chopped parsley (reserve 2 tsp parsley for garnish). Saute for 1-2 minutes till the garlic is fragrant. Spread the mushrooms and herbs out in a single, even layer.Sprinkle the goat cheese evenly across the top of the mushroom and parsley layer.Rewhisk the eggs till fluffy, then pour them evenly over the top of the other ingredients, tilting the pan in each direction to make sure all ingredients are evenly covered with egg. Cook for 2 minutes till the edges begin to solidify and brown a bit. Sprinkle the paprika lightly across the top of the eggs.Place the fritatta carefully in the oven. Let it bake for about 10 minutes, till a knife inserted in the center comes out clean. Remove from oven and allow to cool for a few minutes. It will be puffy when you first take it out of the oven, then it will settle.Slice the fritatta and serve. I plated this with some organic mache greens. It goes great with a light spring salad or Israeli salad on the side, and a slice of whole grain toast if you're not gluten intolerant."},{"vegetarian":false,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":false,"dairyFree":false,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":false,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":7,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":false,"servings":8,"sourceUrl":"http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2012/12/glazed-cocktail-sausage-crescent-roll-sandwich.html","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/glazed-cocktail-sausage-and-crescent-roll-sandwiches-204038","aggregateLikes":72,"creditText":"Serious Eats","sourceName":"Serious Eats","extendedIngredients":[{"id":2048,"aisle":"Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/apple-cider-vinegar.jpg","name":"apple cider vinegar","amount":2,"unit":"teaspoons","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar","metaInformation":[]},{"id":1002030,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pepper.jpg","name":"black pepper","amount":8,"unit":"servings","unitShort":"servings","unitLong":"servings","originalString":"Freshly ground black pepper","metaInformation":["black","freshly ground"]},{"id":2031,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chili-powder.jpg","name":"cayenne pepper","amount":1,"unit":"pinch","unitShort":"pinch","unitLong":"pinch","originalString":"Pinch cayenne pepper","metaInformation":[]},{"id":7235,"aisle":"Meat","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cocktail-sausages.png","name":"cocktail sausages","amount":16,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"16 cocktail sausages, such as Hillshire Farm Lil' Smokies","metaInformation":[" such as hillshire farm lil' smokies"]},{"id":93618,"aisle":"Refrigerated","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/crescent-rolls.jpg","name":"crescent rolls","amount":1,"unit":"can","unitShort":"can","unitLong":"can","originalString":"1 (8-count) can crescent rolls, such as Pillsbury","metaInformation":[" such as pillsbury","(8-count)"]},{"id":10519297,"aisle":"Nut butters, Jams, and Honey","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/grape-jelly.jpg","name":"grape jelly","amount":3,"unit":"tablespoons","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoons","originalString":"3 tablespoons guava or grape jelly","metaInformation":[]},{"id":11935,"aisle":"Condiments","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ketchup.jpg","name":"ketchup","amount":3,"unit":"tablespoons","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoons","originalString":"3 tablespoons ketchup","metaInformation":[]},{"id":2046,"aisle":"Condiments","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/mustard.jpg","name":"spicy brown mustard","amount":2,"unit":"teaspoons","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"2 teaspoons spicy mustard, plus additional for serving","metaInformation":["for serving"]},{"id":1145,"aisle":"Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg","name":"unsalted butter","amount":1,"unit":"tablespoon","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoon","originalString":"1 tablespoon unsalted butter","metaInformation":["unsalted"]}],"id":204038,"title":"Glazed Cocktail Sausage and Crescent Roll Sandwiches","readyInMinutes":20,"image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Glazed-Cocktail-Sausage-and-Crescent-Roll-Sandwiches-204038.jpg","imageType":"jpg","cuisines":[],"instructions":"Procedures                                                                              1                                                                            Bake crescent rolls according to package directions.                                                                                                                            2                                                                            Meanwhile, in small bowl whisk together jelly, ketchup, 2 teaspoons mustard, vinegar, pepper, and cayenne.

As mango begins to break down, press down on it with a fork or potato masher, to mash it. Continue cooking until mango cooks down to form a chunky puree, about 15 minutes. Remove half to serve as a sauce. Set the other half aside for dredging.On a large plate, mix together flour, cornmeal, sugar and salt.Preheat a large skillet. Season salmon with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Brush glaze over top of salmon, then dredge in cornmeal mixture. Add oil and butter to skillet. Over high heat, sear salmon cornmeal mixture face down until golden, about 6 to 8 minutes for medium rare, flipping halfway through to crisp skin.

Once cool, cut asparagus into equal thirds.Turn down oven temperature to 350 degrees.While asparagus is roasting, bring a large pot of water to a boil and cook the pasta.

Remove from pot then add the onion and garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Turn the heat down to medium then add in the milk and whisk in the flour. Let mixture thicken, about 3 minutes, then add the chicken back in along with the pasta and roasted asparagus. Toss the mixture together to coat all the ingredients with the creamy sauce, season with salt and pepper, to taste. Remove from heat and pour into a large 2½ quart casserole dish.In a small bowl, toss panko and parmesan cheese with melted butter.

cups of water to a boil.  Place chilis in a heat-proof bowl.  Cover with boiling water, set a plate on top of the bowl and set aside.Heat olive oil in a large, steep sided skillet over medium heat.  Add onions and cook until soft, 8 to 10 minutes.  Add garlic and cook for another minute.  Stir in chicken stock, water, tomatoes, tomato paste, cumin, oregano, cinnamon, and chilis.  Discard chili soaking water.Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer.  Cook for 15 minutes, or until sauce has slightly thickened.  Taste and add salt if necessary.  If sauce is spicy enough, remove chilis.Place sauce in your VitaMix or blender.  Remove the plug in the top of the blender and cover with a kitchen towel.  This allows steam to escape and will save your blender from blowing it’s top.  Start on low and increase to medium high, pureeing until smooth.  Return to sauce pan and keep warm.Preheat oven to 350F.  Use one 9×13 baking dish or two smaller 8×8 baking dishes.  Wrap 12 corn tortillas in aluminum foil and heat in oven for 10 minutes.  Increase heat to 450F when you remove tortillas.Heat olive oil over medium heat.  Add onions and cook until translucent, 5 – 8 minutes.  Add garlic and cook for another minute, until fragrant.  Add mushrooms and cook until soft.  Move onion mixture to the side of the skillet and brown ground turkey, stirring onion mixture in as turkey cooks. Season to taste with salt and pepper.Set up an assembly line of sorts with your warm tortillas, shredded cheese, turkey & mushroom mixture, and dishes.  Cover the bottom the baking dish with sauce. Put a tablespoon or so of cheese down the middle of the tortilla then fill with a generous 1/4 cup of turkey.  Fold the sides in and place seam side down in the baking dish.  Repeat with remaining tortillas.  Cover with enchilada sauce, top with remaining cheese, and bake for 15 – 20 minutes, until bubbly and cheese is lightly browned.

the oven to 350 degrees F. Line 12 standard muffin cups with paper liners.In a small bowl, stir together the graham-style crumbs, 2 Tbsp sugar and melted butter. Place about 1 Tablespoon into each of the 12 muffin cups. With your fingers, pat it down to cover the bottom of the cup (you should have a little bit leftover to sprinkle on top fo the cupcakes). Sprinkle about 1 teaspoon of the mini chocolate chips over the cookie crust. Bake in the preheated oven for about 5 minutes, or until lightly browned around the edges. Remove from oven while you prepare the cupcake batter.In a large mixing bowl, stir together the brown rice flour, tapioca starch, millet (or sorghum) flour, xanthan gum, sugar, cocoa powder, espresso powder, baking powder and baking soda until well blended. Set aside.In a smaller mixing bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, oil, vanilla and eggs.Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients, and stir until blended.Spoon the batter into the paper cupcake liners, on top of the graham-style crust. Sprinkle with 1 teaspoon of the mini chocolate chips, and the remaining cookie crumb mixture.Bake in preheated oven for 18-20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the middle of the cupcake comes out clean. Remove from oven and allow to sit for 5 minutes before removing from the pan to a cooling rack. Allow to cool completely before frosting.Place the egg whites, sugar and cream of tartar in the heatproof bowl of an electric mixer. Set over a saucepan with simmering water in it, and whisk constantly until the sugar is dissolved and the whites are warm to the touch (about 3-4 minutes).Transfer the bowl to your stand mixer, fitted with a whisk attachment. Starting slow, and gradually increase the speed, beat until stiff, glossy peaks form (about 5-7 minutes). Add vanilla and mix until incorporated.

                                                     Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.                                                                            To start the sauce: Sauté the onion and garlic in the oil in a heavy-bottomedsaucepan set over medium-high heat, until softened, about3 minutes. Stir in the tomato sauce, brown sugar, apple-cider vinegar,salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat, and let simmerfor 15 minutes, so all the flavors can build.                                                                            Set a large pot of water to boil. Lay each collard leaf out on yourwork surface, and remove the tough large stem and center vein. Don'tcut the whole leaf in half; just cut the toughest part of the stem out ina V-shape. Once the water is boiling, slip the collard leaves in and cookuntil tender, about 15 minutes. Drain into a colander, and rinse withcold water to help stop the cooking.                                                                            While the sauce is simmering, begin the dirty rice filling: Heat theoil in a heavy-bottomed sauté pan set over medium-high heat. Brownthe sausage, breaking it up with a wooden spoon. Once the sausage isbrowned, add the onion, green bell pepper, celery, and garlic, cookinguntil softened, about 5 minutes more. Stir in the chicken broth, cayenne,cooked rice, and parsley, mixing thoroughly and letting the brothreduce until there is no moisture left in the pan. Taste, and season withsalt and pepper.                                                                            Lay out each cooked collard leaf and put 1/4 cup of the dirty rice inthe center. Fold both the sides into the center, and the top and bottomover the center. Roll up into a cylinder—tightly, like a cigar or a smallburrito—and repeat with the remaining leaves. If there happen to beany remaining leaves, you can chop them up and add to the sauce.                                                                            Pour a 1/2-inch layer of the sauce into a 13- by-9-inch casserole dish.Arrange the collard rolls, seam sides down, on top of the sauce. Pourthe remaining sauce over the stuff ed collards, and cover the pan withfoil. Bake in the preheated oven for 40 minutes.

Combine the cream and milk in a measuring cup. Pour half of the mixture into a medium pot, add the garlic, Parmesan, and salt, and set the pot over medium heat. Let the liquid come to a simmer and cook for 1 minute, then turn off the heat.

Let it sit for a few minutes, skimming off the froth that develops on the surface with a spoon. Fold a small kitchen towel into a square, put it into a large baking dish, and set the gratin dish on top. Pour enough water into the pot to come to about an inch from the dish’s rim.                                                                                                                            4                                                                            Carefully put the pot in the oven and cook just until the custard has set; it should be slightly firm around the edges but still wobbly in the middle. Remove the pot from the oven and let the custard cool in the water, then remove it. (You can refrigerate the custard overnight, if you wish. I like to serve it at room temperature.)                                                                                                                            5                                                                            Make the asparagus: Heat the olive oil over medium heat in a heavy pan big enough to hold all the asparagus in one layer just until it begins to smoke. Add the asparagus to the pan, lining up the spears in the same direction. The oil should crackle and sizzle a bit. Give the spears a toss with tongs, sprinkle with a good pinch of salt, and spread out in one layer. Cook, turning the spears occasionally, until they’re golden brown in spots and tender but still snappy, about 6 minutes. Give one of the spears a squeeze—it should give just a little; it shouldn’t feel either very firm or mushy.Just a minute before they’re done, sprinkle the basil over the asparagus and drizzle on a little more olive oil. Flip the spears with tongs and play with the basil a little, giving it time against the hot pan and then moving it back onto the asparagus. It’s nice if it gets just a little crispy.                                                                                                                            6                                                                            Take off the heat and let the asparagus gently finish cooking in the heat of the pan, stirring now and then and sprinkling on a little more salt and maybe a splash of lemon juice, if you’d like, just until you can pick up a spear without scalding your fingers.                                                                                                                            7                                                                            Serve the asparagus on a platter with the custard, prosciutto, and olive oil–lashed toasted or grilled bread alongside."},{"vegetarian":false,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":true,"dairyFree":false,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":false,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":20,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":true,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":true,"servings":6,"preparationMinutes":5,"cookingMinutes":25,"sourceUrl":"http://fedandfit.com/2014/11/15/paleo-pumpkin-curry/","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/paleo-pumpkin-curry-620499","aggregateLikes":105,"creditText":"Fed and Fit","sourceName":"Fed and Fit","extendedIngredients":[{"id":5091,"aisle":"Meat","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chicken-thighs.png","name":"chicken thighs","amount":2,"unit":"pounds","unitShort":"lb","unitLong":"pounds","originalString":"2-3 pounds chicken thighs, cut into 1\" cubes","metaInformation":["cut into 1\" cubes"]},{"id":2015,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/curry-powder.jpg","name":"curry powder","amount":2,"unit":"tablespoons","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoons","originalString":"2 tablespoons curry powder","metaInformation":[]},{"id":11216,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ginger.jpg","name":"fresh ginger","amount":1,"unit":"tablespoon","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoon","originalString":"1 tablespoon fresh ginger, finely shaved","metaInformation":["fresh","shaved","finely"]},{"id":12118,"aisle":"Canned and Jarred","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/coconut-milk.jpg","name":"full-fat coconut milk","amount":13.5,"unit":"ounces","unitShort":"oz","unitLong":"ounces","originalString":"13.5 ounces canned full-fat coconut milk","metaInformation":["canned"]},{"id":93632,"aisle":"Ethnic Foods","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ghee.jpg","name":"ghee","amount":2,"unit":"tablespoons","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoons","originalString":"2 tablespoons ghee, grass-fed butter, or EVCO (extra virgin coconut oil)","metaInformation":["grass-fed","(extra virgin coconut oil)"]},{"id":1002030,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pepper.jpg","name":"ground pepper","amount":0.25,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper","metaInformation":["black"]},{"id":9160,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/lime-juice.jpg","name":"juice of lime","amount":2,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"2 limes, juiced","metaInformation":["juiced"]},{"id":11424,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pumpkin-puree.jpg","name":"pumpkin puree","amount":3,"unit":"cups","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"30 ounces pumpkin puree (about 3 cups)","metaInformation":[]},{"id":1012047,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg","name":"sea salt","amount":0.5,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"1/2 teaspoon plus 1 teaspoon sea salt","metaInformation":[]},{"id":11547,"aisle":"Canned and Jarred","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/tomato-paste.jpg","name":"tomato puree","amount":24,"unit":"ounces","unitShort":"oz","unitLong":"ounces","originalString":"24 ounces tomato puree","metaInformation":[]}],"id":620499,"title":"Paleo Pumpkin Curry","readyInMinutes":30,"image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Paleo-Pumpkin-Curry-620499.jpg","imageType":"jpg","cuisines":["asian","indian"],"instructions":"Melt the butter in a large pot or pan.

Note: You want to melt only half of the mixture at one time, because if you melt it all at once, the mixture may begin to harden before you've dipped all of your truffles.                                                                                                                            6                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Take a few of the balls out of the freezer at a time to dip. Place one ball at a time into the candy coating, using a spoon to coat any uncovered areas. Life the coated truffle out of the candy mixture with a spoon, and place it on your prepared sheet of waxed paper to set.                                                                                                                            7                                                                            Repeat with the second half of your candy coating and the remainder of your truffles (or cover up the uncoated truffles and freeze until desired, up to a week).                                                                                                                            8                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 If desired, garnish with sprinkles, gel writing icing, or Easter candy on top.                                                                                                                            9                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Let the coating set for about an hour before serving."},{"vegetarian":false,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":true,"dairyFree":true,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":false,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":9,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":true,"servings":4,"sourceUrl":"http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/weeknight-porchetta-51260410?mbid=nl_042315_Daily_rotd","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/weeknight-porchetta-666168","aggregateLikes":20,"creditText":"Epicurious","sourceName":"Epicurious","extendedIngredients":[{"id":10123,"aisle":"Meat","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/raw-bacon.jpg","name":"bacon","amount":4,"unit":"slices","unitShort":"slices","unitLong":"slices","originalString":"4 slices bacon","metaInformation":[]},{"id":1002030,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pepper.jpg","name":"black pepper","amount":4,"unit":"servings","unitShort":"servings","unitLong":"servings","originalString":"Freshly ground black pepper","metaInformation":["black","freshly ground"]},{"id":2018,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/fennel-seeds.jpg","name":"fennel seeds","amount":1,"unit":"tablespoon","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoon","originalString":"1 tablespoon fennel seeds, coarsely chopped","metaInformation":["coarsely chopped"]},{"id":2063,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/rosemary.jpg","name":"fresh rosemary","amount":1,"unit":"tablespoon","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoon","originalString":"1 tablespoon coarsely chopped fresh rosemary, plus 4 sprigs","metaInformation":["fresh","coarsely chopped"]},{"id":11215,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg","name":"garlic cloves","amount":4,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"4 garlic cloves, finely chopped; plus 2 heads, halved crosswise","metaInformation":["halved","finely chopped"]},{"id":1082047,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg","name":"kosher salt","amount":1.5,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"1 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt","metaInformation":[]},{"id":4053,"aisle":"Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg","name":"olive oil","amount":2,"unit":"tablespoons","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoons","originalString":"2 tablespoons olive oil, divided","metaInformation":["divided"]},{"id":10218,"aisle":"Meat","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pork-tenderloin-raw.png","name":"pork tenderloin","amount":1.5,"unit":"pound","unitShort":"lb","unitLong":"pounds","originalString":"1 1 1/2-pound pork tenderloin","metaInformation":[]}],"id":666168,"title":"Weeknight Porchetta","readyInMinutes":45,"image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Weeknight-Porchetta-666168.jpg","imageType":"jpg","cuisines":[],"instructions":"Preparation                                                        Preheat oven to 425.

In the bowl of a stand mixer (preferably a Bosch) using the paddle attachment, cream the butter and honey.Add the eggs and mix until combined.  Add the milk, vinegar, and yeast mixture.  Stir until combined.Stir the flour and measure 3 cups into a bowl. Stirring helps incorporate air into the flour so you don't get a dense bread.  Add the salt and stir it into the 3 cups of flour.  Switch to the dough hook and add the remaining flour, mixing for 5 minutes until a soft dough is formed.  The dough may look sticky, but if touched your finger, should come away clean.Pour 1 Tbsp of oil into a large bowl.  Scrape dough out of the mixing bowl, and into the bowl with the oil. Flip the dough over so all sides of the dough have oil on them.  Cover with plastic wrap and let rise for 1 hour in a warm place.Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface.  Divide the dough into 26 pieces.  Shape rolls, and then squeeze around the roll to create a small head and larger body.  Place onto a greased/lined baking sheet.  Repeat with all but two of the rolls.  Roll the last two rolls into \"breadsticks\" and cut off little 1-inch pieces for the ears.  Make sure to cut 48 ears with the two \"breadsticks\".  It doesn't take much dough for the ears.  Roll the strips for the ears from the center outwards to make them longer like a snake.  Loop the ears and lay them on the bunny head.  Dip a toothpick in flour and press the bottom of the ears to the head of the bunny.  Then dip the toothpick in flour again and poke two holes for the eyes.  Spray some plastic wrap with pan spray and cover the bunnies to let rise until double in size, about 1 hour.Bake at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for 20 to 25 minutes or until the tops are golden brown.  Remove from the oven and brush melted butter over the top.

Separate the halves of the English muffins and spread them with some of the butter. Set them face down on a griddle to lightly brown. Set aside.Add 1 tablespoon of the butter to a skillet over medium heat. Cut the ham into small circles with a biscuit cutter or ring cutter and quickly brown in the skillet.In the same skillet (or a separate one if you run out of room), place 6 egg rings into the pan and brush with butter all over the interior of the rings. Crack an egg into each ring. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and cook. Flip the eggs over when the white is 80 percent set, after 3 or 4 minutes, and cook about 30 seconds to 1 minute more.Lay out the muffins in a row with the bottoms down and the tops ready to go on. Lay a slice of cheese on each. Lay a slice of ham on each. Lay an egg on each. Put the tops on.

If it is too wet (and mine was) you can add some almond flour or regular breadcrumbs if you want.Heat coconut oil in a pan and bake your meatballs brown.In the meantime chop your garlic and onion and heat a larger pan (the balls will go in there as well) and gently cook the onion and garlic until soft. Once that is done, your meatballs will likely be nicely browned so add them to the garlic/onion mix and add the can of tomatoes too. add the ground chili, salt and pepper.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F in the meantime.OPTIONAL STEP: For a little extra crust on the outside, before baking heat a large skillet over medium to medium-high heat and add 2 Tbsp olive or canola oil. Swirl to coat pan, then add falafel. Carefully flip once golden brown  about 3-4 minutes - and then cook on the other side until golden brown as well - 3-4 more minutes. Return to baking sheet to continue baking. Otherwise, just add them straight to the oven for baking.Bake for a total of 30-40 minutes, flipping once at the halfway point for even cooking. The longer you bake them, the firmer theyll get!Serve warm wrapped in a pita or chard bun and desired sauces / toppings.

Mix with a rubber spatula until combined. Lay out one sheet of puff pastry and roll it with a rolling pin just to flatten slightly. With the pastry set at an angle so that one corner is facing you, spread half of the mortadella mixture onto the half of the puff pastry that is closest to you. Brush the edges with some of the remaining beaten egg. Fold the pastry corner farthest from you over the filling to form a calzone-shaped triangle. Seal the edges either by crimping with your fingers or by using the tines of a fork. Set the pizza on a parchment-lined baking sheet and brush the outside with the remaining egg wash. Cut a slit in the top for ventilation. Repeat with remaining sheet of puff pastry and the remaining filling. Bake for 30 minutes, or until puffed, golden and cooked all the way through.Let rest for 10 minutes before cutting.

Preheat a broiler or grill. Place the peppers on the grill and cook them until they are BLACK on the outside. Yeah that's right BURN THEM!  When the peppers are black on all sides remove them from the heat and place them in an enclosed environment, either a paper bag or a bowl covered with plastic wrap. Let them sit until they are cool. This can be done a day ahead.Using your fingers scrape all the black off the outside of the peppers.  Remove the stem and the seeds as well. This is a messy job, accept it and move on. If needed, you can use a damp paper towel. Rinsing the peppers washes away all of the sweet pepper juices.Once the peppers are clean, cut the peppers into strips that are about 1 inch wide.  Place about a teaspoon of goat cheese at one end of each pepper strip. Sprinkle cheese with a pinch of the crushed red pepper, pimenton and salt.  Roll up each pepper strip around the cheese and garnish with chopped chives.

Place all the ingredients except for bacon and apple wedges in a large mixing bowl and knead well with your hands until uniformly blended. Form the meat mixture into 18 medium sized meatballs. Wrap half a bacon slice around each meatball, making sure that it wraps completely around the meatballs and even overlaps a little bit. If necessary, don’t hesitate to reshape your meatballs and make them slightly oval.Cut each apple wedge in half crosswise.Thread 3 meatballs and 2 pieces of apple per skewer, alternating between meat and fruit. When threading the meatballs, make sure that you insert the skewer right through that spot where the bacon overlaps. This will prevent the bacon from coming undone on the grill.Preheat your grill to medium-high heat. Place the kabobs on the grill and cook until the meatballs are cooked through and the bacon is nice and crispy, about 3-4 minutes per side.

                                                     Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F.Heat a large braiser pan over medium-high heat and add the oil. Sprinkle the lamb shanks all over with 2 teaspoons salt. When the pan and oil are hot, sear the shanks on all sides until deep brown, rotating often, about 8 minutes. Remove the lamb to a plate.To the pan, add the carrots, celery, onions and garlic and cook, stirring often with a wooden spoon, until the vegetables are soft and beginning to brown, about 5 minutes. Add the oregano, rosemary and tomato paste and cook, stirring constantly, for 3 minutes to caramelize the paste. Deglaze the pan with the wine and simmer for 3 minutes. Stir in the chicken stock, then add the lamb shanks back to the pan. Bring to a simmer, reduce the heat to medium-low, and cover the pan.Transfer the pan to the oven and cook until the lamb is fork tender, about 2 hours, turning the shanks halfway through.Meanwhile, in a large bowl, whisk together the honey, Dijon and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Add the escarole and radicchio and toss well to coat. Arrange the bitter greens on a large serving platter.When the lamb is tender, remove the shanks to the platter with the greens. Simmer the sauce until reduced slightly, an additional 10 to 15 minutes. Spoon some of the sauce over the lamb. Serve the remaining sauce on the side, for guests to help themselves. Finish the platter by grating some fresh horseradish over the lamb.

350 degrees.First, take your rice and in a bare hot pan, brown it. Don’t use the butter, the rice browns from the heat alone. At this point, start your kettle boiling for the water you need.When it’s beautifully browned like this, put it into the lidded casserole dish that you are going to bake it in.Take all your veggies and 2 tablespoons of the margarine, and fry them up. You want the mushrooms to lose most of their moisture and the onions and celery to be soft.Take your 2 cubes of bouillon, and dissolve into the 2½ cups of boiling water.

Pour the beer into a turkey sitter (a ceramic stand that holds liquid). Or open the beer can, pour out a few tablespoons and place in a beer-can turkey stand.Combine the mustard powder, garlic powder, dried onion, paprika, granulated garlic, cumin, and salt and pepper to taste in a small bowl.Remove the neck, giblets and any excess fat from the turkey; discard. Rinse the turkey under cold water and pat dry with paper towels. Rub the cavity with 2 to 3 teaspoons of the spice mixture. Brush the outside of the turkey with the canola oil and place drumstick-end down on the sitter or stand. Rub the remaining spice mixture all over the turkey.Place the turkey (on the sitter or stand) on the cooler side of the grill. Cover and cook until the juices run clear and a thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh registers 185 degrees F and 170 degrees F in the breast, 2 to 3 hours. Carefully remove the turkey from the grill, remove from the sitter or stand, and discard the beer. Transfer the turkey to a cutting board and let rest at least 20 minutes before carving.Photograph by Kana Okada                                                    Recipe courtesy of Cat Cora for Food

prepare the bechamel. Melt butter and olive oil together in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Add the flour and cook for 1 minute, whisking constantly, until a smooth paste forms. Continue to cook until the flour loses its starchy aroma. Increase the heat to medium-high, and gradually add in the milk, whisking constantly for about 1 minute, until the mixture is completely smooth. Stir in the grated cheese, chorizo, and paprika, and stir to combine. Season with salt and pepper if needed.Transfer the mixture to a baking dish or bowl that has been greased with cooking spray or oil. Place a layer of plastic wrap directly on the filling mixture, and cover completely, sealing in the edges. Refrigerate until cool and firm, about 1-2 hours.When ready to cook the croquettes, heat oven to 450 degrees F. Remove the filling mixture from the refrigerator. Using your hands or a cookie scoop, form the filling into small balls. Mine were about 1.5-inches in diameter, but you could also make them smaller (about 1-inch diameter).Next, prepare your dipping assembly line. Fill one small bowl with flour. Fill a second with 2 eggs, whisked. And fill a final bowl with panko. Take one filling ball and dip it in the flour until completely coated, then the egg mixture, and finally the panko mixture until it is completely coated. Place ball on a parchment-covered baking sheet. Repeat with remaining filling balls. Then briefly mist the balls with cooking spray or misted olive oil.Transfer sheet to the refrigerator for a final 10 minutes to cool before baking. You want the cheese to be nice and firm so that it doesn't melt too quickly in the oven.When ready, place the baking sheet in the oven and bake for 12-16 minutes, or until the breading is golden and the filling is melted and bubbly. Remove and serve immediately."},{"vegetarian":true,"vegan":true,"glutenFree":true,"dairyFree":true,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":true,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":5,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":false,"servings":10,"preparationMinutes":50,"cookingMinutes":45,"sourceUrl":"http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/2835667/jerk-sweet-potato-and-black-bean-curry","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/jerk-sweet-potato-black-bean-curry-212854","aggregateLikes":769,"creditText":"BBC Good Food","sourceName":"BBC Good Food","extendedIngredients":[{"id":16069,"aisle":"Canned and Jarred","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/lentils-brown.jpg","name":"beans","amount":2,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"2 x 400g cans black beans, rinsed and drained","metaInformation":["black","rinsed","drained","canned"]},{"id":10011693,"aisle":"Canned and Jarred","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/tomatoes-canned.jpg","name":"canned tomatoes","amount":400,"unit":"g","unitShort":"g","unitLong":"grams","originalString":"400g can chopped tomatoes","metaInformation":["chopped","canned"]},{"id":2012,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ground-coriander.jpg","name":"coriander","amount":1,"unit":"bunch","unitShort":"bunch","unitLong":"bunch","originalString":"small bunch coriander, leaves and stalks separated","metaInformation":["separated","small"]},{"id":10019908,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/unprocessed-brown-sugar.png","name":"demerara sugar","amount":3,"unit":"tbsp","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoons","originalString":"3 tbsp demerara sugar","metaInformation":[]},{"id":11216,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ginger.jpg","name":"ginger","amount":50,"unit":"g","unitShort":"g","unitLong":"grams","originalString":"50g ginger, roughly chopped","metaInformation":["roughly chopped"]},{"id":1012009,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garam-masala.jpg","name":"jerk seasoning","amount":3,"unit":"tbsp","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoons","originalString":"3 tbsp jerk seasoning","metaInformation":[]},{"id":11282,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-onion.jpg","name":"onions","amount":2,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"2 onions, 1 diced, 1 roughly chopped","metaInformation":["diced","roughly chopped"]},{"id":1022068,"aisle":"Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/red-wine-vinegar.jpg","name":"red wine vinegar","amount":4,"unit":"tbsp","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoons","originalString":"4 tbsp red wine vinegar","metaInformation":["red"]},{"id":11916,"aisle":"Canned and Jarred","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/red-bell-pepper.png","name":"roasted red peppers","amount":450,"unit":"g","unitShort":"g","unitLong":"grams","originalString":"450g jar roasted red peppers, cut into thick slices","metaInformation":["red","thick","cut into  slices"]},{"id":4584,"aisle":"Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vegetable-oil.jpg","name":"sunflower oil","amount":2,"unit":"tbsp","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoons","originalString":"2 tbsp sunflower oil","metaInformation":[]},{"id":11507,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sweet-potato.jpg","name":"sweet potatoes","amount":1,"unit":"kg","unitShort":"kg","unitLong":"kg","originalString":"1kg sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into chunks","metaInformation":["peeled","cut into chunks"]},{"id":2049,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/thyme.jpg","name":"thyme sprigs","amount":2,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"2 thyme sprigs","metaInformation":[]},{"id":98845,"aisle":"Canned and Jarred","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/bouillon-cube.jpg","name":"vegetable stock cubes","amount":2,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"2 vegetable stock cubes, crumbled","metaInformation":["crumbled"]}],"id":212854,"title":"Jerk sweet potato & black bean curry","readyInMinutes":95,"image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Jerk-sweet-potato---black-bean-curry-212854.jpg","imageType":"jpg","cuisines":["asian","indian"],"instructions":"Gently soften the diced onion in thesunflower oil in a big pan or casserole.Meanwhile, whizz together the roughlychopped onion, ginger, coriander stalksand jerk seasoning with a hand-heldblender.

Warm up half of the Tangerine Sauce in a saute pan on medium heat.Remove the octopus from the poaching liquid and allow to cool before handling, about 10 minutes. Remove the head and discard. Cut off the tentacles from the body and reserve the body for another use. Dip the tentacles into the reserved bacon fat, and place on the hot grill to char very briefly. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer the tentacles to a large ovenproof saute pan, toss with the heated Tangerine Sauce and place in the oven for 5 minutes.To serve, drizzle some of the remaining Tangerine Sauce on each plate. Sprinkle some of the crushed peppercorns and oregano leaves around each plate. Place a tentacle on each plate and sprinkle with some of the bacon. Garnish with the Bulls Blood microgreens and micro arugula. Finish with a drizzle of oil and some freshly ground black pepper.                                                Tangerine Sauce:                                        Reduce the juice and honey in a saute pan over medium heat until syrupy. Allow to cool slightly. Combine in a food processor with the red wine vinegar, mustard, anchovies and chile and process until smooth. While processing, drizzle in enough canola oil to create an emulsified sauce. Season with salt and pepper.

This will help to prevent the cake from sticking when you roll it up.Place a lint-free, thin kitchen towel over the cake, making sure that the cake is covered, and one edge lines up with the 10-inch side of the cake. Place a cooling rack on top of the cloth, and carefully flip the baking pan upside down, turning the cake onto the cooling rack.Carefully remove the parchment paper from the bottom of the cake and, starting on the 10-inch side, roll the cake into a log. Be sure to roll the cloth along with the cake, that will ensure that you can unroll it later to put the filling in. Allow the cake to cool for about 1 hour.Beat together the softened cream cheese and butter until smooth. Add the confectioners’ sugar and vanilla. Beat until smooth again.Unroll the pumpkin cake, and spread the cream cheese filling over the cake, leaving 1-inch clear at the 10-inch side that will be the outside of the roll.Roll up the cake again, this time without the cloth. I like to roll the cake up in the lint-free towel again, just to help hold it’s shape. Wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 4 hours before serving. The Pumpkin Roll Cake can be made one or two days in advance.Remove from the refrigerator 30 minutes before serving to allow the filling to soften slightly.

wrap. Keep the roll of plastic wrap handy, and set aside. Melt the chocolate and hold it warm in a bowl set over some hot water.                                                                                                                             2                                                                             In a medium sized bowl, combine the starch and half the sugar and whisk together until incorporated. Add the eggs and yolks and whisk for 2 minutes without stopping. Set aside. In a medium saucepan, combine half the sugar, milk, salt and stir. Set over medium heat and bring to a simmer. Temper the egg mixture with the hot milk a little at a time, whisking thoroughly between additions. Pour the liquid back into the pot and whisk over low heat.                                                                                                                             3                                                                            Continue to whisk as the mixture thickens. Whisk through the lumps until the pastry cream becomes smooth. When it begins to bubble, whisk for two additional minutes, then remove from heat. Whisk in the butter and vanilla extract until they melt and fully incorporate. With a large rubber spatula, stir in the warm, melted chocolate until it is fully blended. Scrape the pastry cream onto the prepared sheet and press another layer of plastic over the surface. Allow it to cool to room temperature.

                Watch how to make this recipe.                                                        Special equipment: butcher's twineTo brine the turkey: Combine all of the ingredients for the brine in a large container. Add the turkey and let it brine in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 days.To prepare the turkey for cooking: Remove the turkey from the brine the night before roasting and pat it thoroughly dry with paper towels. Combine the rosemary, sage, and butter for the herb crust in a small bowl. Season, to taste, with kosher salt. Work the butter under the skin of the turkey and massage it into the breasts and the legs. Massage the butter on the outside of the skin as well. Tie the legs together over the breast so they will protect it during cooking and help keep it moist and juicy.Gravy preparation: Put the onions, carrots, celery, garlic, apples, bay leaves, cinnamon stick and thyme in a roasting pan and season with salt.  Arrange the turkey on top of the veggies and refrigerate overnight UNCOVERED!  Yes, that's right, uncovered.  This will help the skin dry out and become really brown and crispy. Make sure that there is no raw food near the turkey in the refrigerator. After refrigerating overnight, the turkey is ready to go in the oven.Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.Put 2 cups chicken stock and 1 cup apple cider in the bottom of the roasting pan. Roast the turkey in the preheated oven until the skin gets really nice and brown, about 40 minutes. Lower the oven heat to 350 degrees F for the remainder of the cooking time. Baste the turkey every 30 minutes or so and add more stock to the roasting pan, if needed. Cook about 17 minutes per pound. Once it gets to the proper color, tent the turkey with aluminum foil to prevent it from getting too dark.Remove the turkey from the oven when an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the turkey registers 160 degrees F. Make sure that the thermometer is not touching a bone when doing the reading.  When the turkey has reached the proper temperature, remove it from the roasting pan to a cutting board and let it rest for at least 30 minutes. Cover loosely with aluminum foil.Strain all the veggies over a bowl to separate them from the stock/mixture. Discard the veggies. Skim off the fat and add it to the roasting pan. This is the fat for the roux. Put the roasting pan over 2 burners and over a low heat and whisk in the flour. Cook until the mixture looks like wet sand, about 4 to 5 minutes. Slowly whisk in the remaining 1 cup apple cider, remaining chicken stock and the stock/cider mixture. Cook until the mixture has thickened and reached a gravy consistency.  Taste and adjust the seasoning. Pour into a serving pitcher or bowl.Carve the turkey, transfer to a serving platter and serve with the gravy.Cook's Note: Don't fight over the drumsticks.Give thanks for such a great turkey!!!

Run the processor until the mixture comes together. This took mine about 1-2 minutes. If, for some reason, the mixture is not able to form balls after the processing (if it’s too crumbly still) you can add up to 1 more ounce of cream cheese, but mine only needed 2 ounces. Scoop 1 tablespoon sized balls and place them on a wax paper lined cookie sheet. Chill while you prepare your candy. Melt white chocolate according to package directions. Halfway through melting, add the peanut butter to the bowl. Stir often, until smooth. (I heated mine for about 1 1/2 minutes on HIGH, stirring every 30 seconds and adding the peanut butter after 45 seconds.) Tip: heat an electric griddle to 200°F and line it with a kitchen towel. Place your bowl of melted candy on the griddle so it stays melted during dipping. Dip each truffle in the candy and tap off the excess. I use a spoon to coat the candy, then I place the truffle on a fork and tap off the dripping candy. Use a toothpick to carefully transfer the truffle from the fork back to the cookie sheet. Repeat with all the truffles. If it’s cool in your house and the truffles have hardened by the time you dip them all, re-dip immediately. If they’re still wet, chill until hardened, then do the second dipping. We’re double dipping because the dark truffle shows through the light coating. The second dip is optional. Decorate with sprinkles while still wet from the second dip. Chill until set."},{"vegetarian":false,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":true,"dairyFree":true,"veryHealthy":true,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":false,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":19,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":false,"servings":4,"preparationMinutes":45,"cookingMinutes":0,"sourceUrl":"http://lemonsandanchovies.com/2012/04/crockpot-pork-and-beans/","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/slow-cooker-pork-and-beans-568618","aggregateLikes":27,"creditText":"Lemons and Anchovies","sourceName":"Lemons and Anchovies","extendedIngredients":[{"id":2004,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/bay-leaves.jpg","name":"bay leaf","amount":1,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"1 bay leaf","metaInformation":[]},{"id":16069,"aisle":"Canned and Jarred","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/lentils-brown.jpg","name":"beans","amount":0.5,"unit":"pound","unitShort":"lb","unitLong":"pounds","originalString":"½ pound dried Snowcap beans (or northern beans)","metaInformation":["dried","(or northern beans)"]},{"id":10011693,"aisle":"Canned and Jarred","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/tomatoes-canned.jpg","name":"canned tomatoes","amount":14.5,"unit":"oz","unitShort":"oz","unitLong":"ounces","originalString":"1 14.5 oz can diced tomatoes","metaInformation":["diced","canned"]},{"id":6179,"aisle":"Ethnic Foods","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/asian-fish-sauce.jpg","name":"fish sauce","amount":1,"unit":"tablespoon","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoon","originalString":"1 tablespoon fish sauce (optional)","metaInformation":[]},{"id":2049,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/thyme.jpg","name":"fresh thyme","amount":0.5,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"½ teaspoon dried or fresh thyme","metaInformation":["fresh"]},{"id":11215,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg","name":"garlic","amount":3,"unit":"cloves","unitShort":"cloves","unitLong":"cloves","originalString":"3 cloves garlic, chopped","metaInformation":["chopped"]},{"id":11282,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-onion.jpg","name":"onion","amount":0.5,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"½ onion, chopped","metaInformation":["chopped"]},{"id":10010219,"aisle":"Meat","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pork-tenderloin-raw.png","name":"pork","amount":1.5,"unit":"pound","unitShort":"lb","unitLong":"pounds","originalString":"1½ pound boneless pork cut in stew-size pieces, frozen","metaInformation":["boneless","frozen","cut in stew-size pieces, "]},{"id":2047,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg","name":"salt and pepper","amount":4,"unit":"servings","unitShort":"servings","unitLong":"servings","originalString":"salt and pepper, to taste","metaInformation":["to taste"]},{"id":11887,"aisle":"Pasta and Rice","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/tomato-paste.jpg","name":"tomato paste","amount":1,"unit":"tablespoon","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoon","originalString":"1 tablespoon tomato paste","metaInformation":[]},{"aisle":"?","name":"on the stove","amount":2,"unit":"cups","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"2 - 2¼ cups chicken stock, warmed in microwave or on the stove","metaInformation":[]}],"id":568618,"title":"Slow Cooker Pork and Beans","readyInMinutes":45,"image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Slow-Cooker-Pork-and-Beans-568618.jpg","imageType":"jpg","cuisines":[],"instructions":"Add all the ingredients into the slow cooker from the beans to the bay leaf in the list above.

Add 1/4 cup oil, the lemon zest and juice, oregano and the chicken. Seal the bag tightly and use your hands to vigorously massage the marinade into the chicken, making sure that the chicken is evenly coated. Marinate for at least 10 minutes at room temperature.Meanwhile, remove the rind from the watermelon, cut the fruit into 1-inch cubes and put in a large mixing bowl. (You should have about 6 cups total.) Quarter the cucumber lengthwise and cut into 1-inch pieces. Place on top of the watermelon in the mixing bowl. Cut the feta into 1/2-inch cubes, put on top of the cucumber and top with the Kalamata olives. (Do not mix yet.) Reserve.Remove the chicken from the marinade and place on a platter. Lightly oil the grill grates. Sprinkle the chicken liberally with salt and pepper and arrange the pieces skin-side down on the grill, leaving some space between the pieces. Cook until the skin is lightly charred and releases itself from the grill, about 2 minutes. Then rotate the chicken about 90 degrees so that the skin won't burn and cook another 2 minutes. Flip and cook for an additional 5 minutes. Cover the grill and cook until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the deepest part of each chicken thigh reads 165 degrees F, about 5 more minutes. Transfer to a platter and rest for at least 5 minutes before serving.While the chicken is resting, brush the cut sides of the baguette halves with 2 tablespoons oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Arrange the bread cut-side down on the grill until lightly charred and warmed through, about 2 minutes. Halve the remaining garlic clove and lightly rub the cut sides of the garlic onto the hot bread. Halve each piece of baguette.Scatter most of the mint over the watermelon mixture.  Add the remaining 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil and a large pinch of salt and pepper and gently stir to combine.Divide the watermelon salad among 4 large dinner plates along with a piece of chicken and some bread. Garnish with the remaining mint and serve immediately.Copyright 2014 Television Food Network, G.P. All rights reserved.

To toast the pecans, place a medium frying pan on the stove top. Turn on medium-high heat. When the pan is hot, add a single layer of pecans. Stir frequently with a spatula until they start looking darker and you can smell the toasted nuts. Remove from heat and spread out on a plate to cool to room temperature. Make sure you watch the pecans closely, they can burn pretty quickly and they will keep cooking after removing them from the pan.3. While the pecans are cooling, make the dressing. In a small jar, add the olive oil, apple cider vinegar, Dijon mustard, salt, and pepper. Put a lid on the jar and shake until mixed well. 4. Add the toasted pecans, dried cranberries, and blue cheese to the chopped brussels sprouts. Pour the dressing over the salad and toss until all of the ingredients are well coated. Serve immediately.

Roll the Cocoa Puffs in the chocolate, coating them completely. Lift them out with a fork, letting the excess chocolate drip off, and place on a parchment-lined baking sheet to set. Store in a cool place.                                                            For the Chocolate Soup (makes about 4 1/2 cups):                Put 1 cup of the milk in a small saucepan with the juniper berries. Bring to a boil, then turn off the heat and let the juniper infuse for 25 minutes. Have the chopped chocolate ready in a heatproof bowl, and, remember, the finer you've chopped the chocolate, the better.                                                                Bring the milk back to a boil, then strain into a measuring cup. Add some of the remaining 3 cups milk, if needed, to make 1 cup.

For the Devon Foam:                Whisk the heavy cream and Devon cream together in a bowl until thick. Whisk in the milk, then froth with an immersion blender (add additional milk if you need to). Transfer to a pitcher and refrigerate until you're ready to serve.                                                            To Serve:                Thin the chocolate soup with some cold milk if it's too thick to sip, and froth it again with an immersion blender.

Position a rack in the center of the oven and heat the oven to 425F.    In a medium bowl, combine the panko, butter, parsley, and lemon zest. Add a pinch of salt and a grind of pepper and stir to evenly distribute the ingredients.    Line a heavy-duty rimmed baking sheet with parchment. Arrange the cod fillets on the baking sheet and season all over with salt and pepper. Divide the panko topping among the fillets, pressing lightly so it adheres. Roast until the breadcrumbs are browned and the fish is mostly opaque (just cooked through), with a trace of translucence in the center (cut into a piece to check), 10 to 12 minutes, depending on the thickness of the fillets.

When the breadcrumbs are ready, mix them together with the ground beef, ground pork, black pepper, onion, soy sauce, and salt in a large bowl. Knead the meat until it becomes sticky and binds together; divide the mixture into 4 equal parts. Lightly dab your hands with sesame oil. Using your palms, roll each part of the meat into a ball, then pat the ball flat, shifting it from hand to hand, to form a 1/2-inch-thick patty (patting like this compresses the meat and removes air pockets). Press down to make an indentation in the center of the patty (which prevents the patty from puffing up into a ball while it grills). Place the completed patties on a sheet of aluminum foil.                                                                                                                             3                                                                            Preheat a grill to medium. Grill the burgers until they’re nicely browned, about 10 minutes, flipping twice. These burgers have to cook through completely because of the pork; you’ll see no pink in the middle, but they’ll still be incredibly juicy and tasty. Let the burgers rest for 2 minutes. Spoon the wasabi ketchup on top and serve."},{"vegetarian":true,"vegan":true,"glutenFree":true,"dairyFree":true,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":false,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":1,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":false,"servings":4,"preparationMinutes":10,"cookingMinutes":0,"sourceUrl":"http://www.lifesambrosia.com/2009/04/cucumber-salad-with-sweet-thai-chili-vinaigrette-recipe.html","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/cucumber-salad-with-sweet-thai-chili-vinaigrette-567787","aggregateLikes":25,"creditText":"Lifes Ambrosia","sourceName":"Lifes Ambrosia","extendedIngredients":[{"id":11206,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cucumber.jpg","name":"cucumber","amount":1,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"1 cucumber, thinly sliced","metaInformation":["thinly sliced"]},{"id":1002020,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic-powder.jpg","name":"granulated garlic","amount":0.25,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"1/4 teaspoon granulated garlic","metaInformation":[]},{"id":1082047,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg","name":"kosher salt","amount":4,"unit":"servings","unitShort":"servings","unitLong":"servings","originalString":"Kosher salt to taste","metaInformation":["to taste"]},{"id":11282,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-onion.jpg","name":"onion","amount":0.5,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"1/2 onion, thinly sliced","metaInformation":["thinly sliced"]},{"id":1022053,"aisle":"Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vinegar-(white).jpg","name":"rice vinegar","amount":2,"unit":"tablespoons","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoons","originalString":"2 tablespoons rice vinegar","metaInformation":[]},{"id":4058,"aisle":"Ethnic Foods","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sesame-oil.jpg","name":"sesame oil","amount":1,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoon","originalString":"1 teaspoon sesame oil","metaInformation":[]},{"id":19335,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg","name":"sugar","amount":0.25,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"1/4 teaspoon sugar","metaInformation":[]},{"id":98962,"aisle":"Ethnic Foods","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/fish-sauce.jpg","name":"sweet chili sauce","amount":2,"unit":"tablespoons","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoons","originalString":"2 tablespoons sweet Thai chili sauce","metaInformation":[]}],"id":567787,"title":"Cucumber Salad with Sweet Thai Chili Vinaigrette","readyInMinutes":10,"image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Cucumber-Salad-with-Sweet-Thai-Chili-Vinaigrette-567787.jpg","imageType":"jpg","cuisines":["american"],"instructions":"In a small bowl whisk together rice vinegar, sweet Thai chili sauce, sesame oil, sugar, granulated garlic and salt.Place sliced cucumber and onion in another bowl.

Prepare the marinade in a large bowl, stirring together all of the marinade ingredients.  Place steak in the bowl and coat on all sides with the marinade.  Let the steak sit in the marinade and come to room temperature while you prepare the grill.  (No need to marinate the steak more than 20 minutes or so.)2 Prepare the grill for direct high heat.  If you are using charcoal, use approximately 5 pounds of coals.  Bank the coals so that more of them are on one side than the other, so that you have a high heat zone and a lower heat zone.3 When the grill is ready and hot, remove the meat from the marinade and dry it all around with paper towels.  Sprinkle all sides of the tri-tip generously with both salt and freshly ground black pepper.  4 Place the tri-tip on the grill, on the hot direct heat side.  Leave the cover off and watch carefully for flare-ups.  As the meat browns, any fat will melt and drip on to the coals causing flare-ups.  These are okay, as long as they don't get out of control.  Keep moving the tri-tip around the grill away from the flames if they get too high.  After one side of the meat is browned (about 5 minutes) use tongs to flip it on to the other side.  When it is browned all around, move the tri-tip to the lower heat side of the grill.  Cover the grill and close the vents enough so that you maintain about 300-325°F temperature in the grill. (If you are using a charcoal grill, you can place a meat thermometer through the vents to measure the heat.)  If you are using a gas grill, turn off one of the burners and move the meat over that burner for indirect heating. 5 Cook the tri-tip until a meat thermometer reads 130°F when inserted into the thickest part of the meat (15-30 minutes, depending on the thickness of the meat).  Remove the tri-tip from the grill.  Cover with aluminum foil and let rest for 10 minutes.6 Prepare the salsa by combining all of the salsa ingredients into a small bowl.7 Cut the tri-tip in 1/4-inch slices against the grain.  Serve with the salsa."},{"vegetarian":true,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":true,"dairyFree":false,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":false,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":8,"gaps":"GAPS_FULL","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":false,"servings":4,"preparationMinutes":15,"cookingMinutes":0,"sourceUrl":"http://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/sauteed-green-beans","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/sauteed-green-beans-397045","aggregateLikes":58,"creditText":"Taste of Home","sourceName":"Taste of Home","extendedIngredients":[{"id":16069,"aisle":"Canned and Jarred","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/lentils-brown.jpg","name":"beans","amount":9,"unit":"ounces","unitShort":"oz","unitLong":"ounces","originalString":"1 package (9 ounces) frozen cut green beans, thawed","metaInformation":["green","frozen","thawed","cut "]},{"id":1001,"aisle":"Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg","name":"butter","amount":2,"unit":"tablespoons","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoons","originalString":"2 tablespoons butter","metaInformation":[]},{"id":2003,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/basil.jpg","name":"dried basil","amount":0.25,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"1/4 teaspoon each dried basil, oregano and parsley flakes","metaInformation":["dried"]},{"id":11284,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/onion-powder.jpg","name":"dried onion","amount":1,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoon","originalString":"1 teaspoon dried minced onion","metaInformation":["dried","minced"]},{"id":2047,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg","name":"salt","amount":0.25,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"1/4 teaspoon salt","metaInformation":[]}],"id":397045,"title":"Sauteed Green Beans","readyInMinutes":15,"image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Sauteed-Green-Beans-397045.jpg","imageType":"jpg","cuisines":[],"instructions":"Directions                                                                                In a large skillet, saute beans in butter for 4-5 minutes.

Add the butter and egg mixture and beat for 20 seconds. Scrape the sides of the bowl and add the blackberry mixture. Beat for 20-30 seconds until the batter is smooth.

Pat dry eggplant and brush both sides generously with olive oil, place on backing sheet.Make dressing. Blend all ingredients in a blender or food processor...adding a little more water  (only if necessary) to get the blender going. Do not blend too smooth... you want to see pieces of the herbs.Grill eggplant slices, covering grill, checking heat to make sure they don't burn, rotating as necessary. Eggplant is done when the white becomes slightly translucent. Stack them on a heat proof dish and cover tightly with foil so they continue cooking through. You could place this on your upper grill rack if you have one, or just set aside, covered.  Grill tomato slices, just a few minutes on each side. If you grill too long, they will fall apart, so just a couple minutes, just to warm them is enough.Grill the Halloumi cheese just until grill marks appear.Arrange all on a platter, layering drizzle with the dressing and a sprinkle of salt and pepper, and garnish with fresh mint leaves. Serve at room temp. If you want to serve this Napoleon Style- a stacked individual portion, layer eggplant, tomato, and haloumi spooning a little mint dressing on each layer, until 4-5 inches tall.

Mince cilantro stems.Rinse and score the chicken pieces, at the thickest part, lightly with a knife.Chop Thai chilies and Thai palm sugar into small pieces.Make a coarse paste with the lemongrass, cilantro stems, chilies, and peppercorns using a mortar and pestle (or a mini-food processor).Mix in the fish sauce and palm sugar until the sugar dissolves.Coat the chicken with this spice paste. I put the spice paste and chicken in a Ziploc bag. Marinate in the fridge for at least one hour. Marinating chicken overnight always improves the flavor and tenderization.Preheat the grill to medium-low heat. Slowly grill the chicken, turning often until cooked through and golden brown all over. Alternatively you can rotisserie, bake, or broil this chicken until cooked through to an internal temperature of 165F (75C). We have a gas grill, but we also like cooking on a grill over charcoal so the flavor is good.For Thai Sweet Chili Sauce, combine all the ingredients in a small saucepan and bring to a boil.Boil over medium heat for 10 minutes or until the mixture has reduced to 1 cup (250ml). It might be still runny and not syrupy, but it will thicken further as it cools.Remove from the heat and cool to room temperature before storing in the refrigerator for up to a few months.Serve with

This will allow the fat to drain while cooking. Add to large frying pan. Add about 1/4-inch water. Brown the sausages. You can start it out on high and then once the water has evaporated lower the temperature to medium-high. Once the sausages are brown remove from range. There is no need to cook them all the way through. Pat off excess oil with a paper towel. Set aside to cool. Once cooled slice width wise into about 1/3-inch circles. If you wish to add meatballs this would be the time to make and brown them and set them aside as well.Heat your stock pot. Once heated add olive oil.Add onion and garlic and sauté until onions are transparent.Add sliced all meat, including sausage, and cook until meat is no longer read on outside.Add mushrooms, parsley, Italian seasoning and wine; cover; and sauté 10 minutes more.While the mixture is sautéing, empty whole tomatoes into a bowl with 2 knives cut up into small pieces or pulsate in a food processor. You want to leave the tomatoes a little chunky. You use can also use diced canned tomatoesOnce the meat mixture has completed the 10 minutes of sautéing, add the chopped tomatoes, tomato sauce and tomato paste into the meat mixture pot. You can use some hot water to get the last bit out of the cans by scraping the sides of the can with a spoon. If you use about a half to a whole can of water for each can of tomato sauce and paste you will have enough water in your sauce.Add sugar, stir. Add meatballs, if you desire. Let simmer for at least 3 hours. The longer it cooks the better it will taste.As the sauce becomes too thick add additional water to taste. Some like it really thick and others like it saucy.Freeze leftovers in several air tight containers. I like to freeze several different sizes, for individual meals, family meals and for company."},{"vegetarian":false,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":true,"dairyFree":false,"veryHealthy":true,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":false,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":14,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":false,"servings":4,"preparationMinutes":20,"cookingMinutes":60,"sourceUrl":"http://kitchenconfidante.com/toasted-quinoa-stuffed-artichokes-recipe","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/toasted-quinoa-stuffed-artichokes-497024","aggregateLikes":114,"creditText":"Kitchen Confidante","sourceName":"Kitchen Confidante","extendedIngredients":[{"id":11007,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/artichokes.jpg","name":"artichokes","amount":6,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"6 artichokes","metaInformation":[]},{"id":1002030,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pepper.jpg","name":"black pepper","amount":4,"unit":"servings","unitShort":"servings","unitLong":"servings","originalString":"freshly ground black pepper","metaInformation":["black","freshly ground"]},{"id":11165,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cilantro.png","name":"cilantro","amount":0.5,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"1/2 cup cilantro, chopped","metaInformation":["chopped"]},{"id":1019,"aisle":"Cheese","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/feta-cheese.jpg","name":"feta cheese","amount":1,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cup","originalString":"1 cup diced feta cheese","metaInformation":["diced"]},{"id":11215,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg","name":"garlic","amount":2,"unit":"cloves","unitShort":"cloves","unitLong":"cloves","originalString":"2 cloves garlic, minced","metaInformation":["minced"]},{"id":1082047,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg","name":"kosher salt","amount":4,"unit":"servings","unitShort":"servings","unitLong":"servings","originalString":"kosher salt","metaInformation":[]},{"id":9150,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/lemon.jpg","name":"lemons","amount":2,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"2 lemons","metaInformation":[]},{"id":4053,"aisle":"Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg","name":"olive oil","amount":0.25,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"1/4 cup olive oil, plus more for drizzling","metaInformation":["plus more for drizzling"]},{"id":1033,"aisle":"Cheese","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/parmesan-or-romano.jpg","name":"parmesan cheese","amount":0.5,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese","metaInformation":["grated"]},{"id":11297,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/parsley.jpg","name":"parsley","amount":0.5,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"1/2 cup parsley, chopped","metaInformation":["chopped"]},{"id":20035,"aisle":"Pasta and Rice","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/uncooked-quinoa.png","name":"quinoa","amount":1,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cup","originalString":"1 cup quinoa","metaInformation":[]},{"id":11677,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/shallots.jpg","name":"shallot","amount":1,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"1 shallot, minced","metaInformation":["minced"]}],"id":497024,"title":"Toasted Quinoa Stuffed Artichokes","readyInMinutes":80,"image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Toasted-Quinoa-Stuffed-Artichokes-497024.jpg","imageType":"jpg","cuisines":[],"instructions":"Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.Rinse the quinoa in a fine sieve, then drain excess water. Place the drained quinoa in a frying pan over medium heat. It will take the water a few minute to evaporate, then as the quinoa dries, it will begin to toast. Stir periodically until the quinoa is evenly browned and gives off a lovely nutty aroma. Set aside 1/4 cup of the toasted quinoa.Place the remaining 3/4 cup quinoa and 1 cup water in a saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat. Lower the heat to a simmer, and cook for about 10 minutes. Cover and let the quinoa sit for 5 minutes more. The water should be fully absorbed. Drain any excess water if necessary.While the quinoa cooks and cools, prepare the artichokes. Fill a large bowl with cool water, then squeeze the juice of two lemons into the water, and drop the lemons into water, as well. Remove the outer leaves of the artichoke by snapping them off, until you are left with the tender leaves within. Cut about 1 1/2 inches off the tops of the artichoke, then remove the purple choke inside by scooping it out with a spoon. Trim the stems of the artichoke, then peel the tough outer layer of the stem. Place the artichokes in the lemon water bath. Repeat with remaining artichokes.In a medium bowl, combine the cooked quinoa, feta, parmesan, garlic, shallot, cilantro and parsley. Stir in the olive oil and toss to evenly coat the stuffing. Stuff the artichokes well with the stuffing, topping it with some of the reserved toasted quinoa, and place in a baking dish. Drizzle with a little olive oil and season with salt and pepper.

parsnip pure:  Bring 1 quart of water to a boil on the stove in a large saucepot, add parsnips and boil until parsnips are well cooked and fall apart easily (about 30 minutes) Strain and reserve cooking liquid for the tomato broth, then add hot parsnips, butter and cream to a blender and blend on high until smooth, adding some additional cooking liquid if needed until desired consistency is reached. Season with salt and pepper and set aside until ready to serve.  For the tomato broth:  Slice tomatoes in half and toss with olive oil and chopped garlic in a mixing bowl. Place in a small baking dish and roast in a 350F oven until soft but not mushy. Rough chop and set aside. In a saucepan, combine the cooked chopped tomatoes and 2 cups of the reserved parsnip cooking liquid. Reduce down until it thickens slightly. Add salt and pepper to taste.  For the meatballs:  Begin by roasting the beets. Preheat oven to 350F and rinse the outside of the beets to remove any dirt or debris that may be on them. Place them in a small baking dish with a little water on the bottom and cover with foil the water will prevent the beets from scorching. Roast in the oven for about 1 hour, or until a fork inserted can be removed easily. Remove beets from dish and place in the refrigerator to cool. Once cooled, use a dish rag or strong paper towel and wipe the skin on the outside of the beets. It will come off easily. Grate the skinned beets on a fine cheese grater and reserve until later. Spread out cooked rice on a cookie sheet or large plate and allow to cool to room temperature. In a large saut pan over medium-high heat, saut the onions, celery and carrots for 5 minutes, stirring constantly. Add the mushrooms and cook an additional 4 minutes or so. Season liberally with salt and black pepper and then add the cooled shredded beets and toss to combine. Allow this mixture to cool to room temperature as well by spreading on a cookie sheet or large plate. Once everything has cooled, combine all ingredients excluding the eggs in a large mixing bowl and check seasonings, then add eggs. Roll mixture into 2-ounce balls and place in a dish close together, flattening the bottom a little so they do not roll around. Roast at 350F for 20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean. Serve the meatballs over the parsnip pure with a little parsnip and tomato broth on top.

For the meat mixture: Combine the ground beef, breadcrumbs, ketchup, dry mustard, Worcestershire sauce, bouillon and some salt and pepper. Knead until all combined. Form into 4 to 6 oval patties, and then make lines across the patties to give them a \"steak\" appearance.Fry the patties in a skillet with the butter and oil over medium-high heat on both sides until no longer pink in the middle. Remove from the skillet and pour off any excess grease.For the gravy: Reduce the heat to medium and add in the sliced onions. Stir and cook until golden brown and somewhat soft, for several minutes. Add the beef stock, ketchup, seasoning sauce, if using, and the Worcestershire. Then combine the cornstarch with a little beef broth and add to the sauce if using. Stir and cook to reduce.Add a sprinkle of salt and pepper and more broth if needed for thinning. Then return the patties to the gravy. Spoon the gravy over the top and let them simmer and heat back up for a couple of minutes.                                                    2012 Ree Drummond, All Rights Reserved

Place turkey on a rack in a shallow roasting pan, breast side up. With fingers, carefully loosen skin from the turkey breast; rub half of the butter mixture under the skin. Rub remaining butter mixture over turkey. Tuck wings under turkey; tie drumsticks together.                                                                                            Bake at 325° for 3 to 3-3/4 hours or until a thermometer inserted in thigh reads 180°. Baste occasionally with pan drippings.                                                                                           For stuffing, in a Dutch oven, cook sausage over medium heat for 6-8 minutes or until no longer pink, breaking into crumbles. Remove with a slotted spoon; drain on paper towels. Discard drippings, reserving 1 tablespoon.

Stir in enough broth to reach desired moistness; transfer to a greased 11-in. x 7-in. baking dish. Bake, covered, for 30 minutes. Uncover and bake 10-15 minutes longer or until lightly browned.                                                                                           Remove turkey from oven; cover loosely with foil and let stand for 20 minutes before carving. Serve with stuffing.

Scoop out dough balls roughly the size of a golf ball and bake for 14 minutes or until the tops of the cookies are done. (Just gently press on the top of a cookie and make sure it \"springs\" back like a cake or muffin would, you don't want to under-bake these cookies.) 4. Let cool.5. Cream Cheese Frosting: Beat cream cheese and butter together. Add powdered sugar and vanilla.  To make thicker, add more powdered sugar, if you want to make in thinner, add a little milk! 6. Frost the top of your cookies and then sprinkle some Heath bits on top! The Heath adds a great crunch and toffee is a perfect pairing for the

                                                                             1                                                                            To make the Tupperware Mexican Chorizo: Put all the ingredients except the oil into a bowl and mix thoroughly with your hands, squishing the mix through your fingers to distribute the seasonings evenly.                                                                                                                             2                                                                            Cover the mixture and store in the fridge for at least 2 hours before using; this will allow the flavors time to develop. It will keep for about 1 week.                                                                                                                            3                                                                            To make the Chorizo Carbonara: Add the pasta to a large saucepan of well-salted boiling water and cook until al dente.                                                                                                                            4                                                                            Meanwhile, heat the oil in a frying pan. Add the chorizo and fry briskly for about 10 minutes, until crisp and cooked through. If you’re using the soft Tupperware chorizo, you can start with a bit of a lump and break it up with a spatula as it fries, so it forms lots of succulent little nuggets and crumbs, thereby maximizing the surface area available for crisping.                                                                                                                            5                                                                            Beat the egg yolks and cream together and season lightly (since the chorizo is already highly seasoned).                                                                                                                            6                                                                            When the pasta is done, drain thoroughly and immediately return it to the hot pan. Tip in the crisp chorizo, followed by the egg mixture. Use 2 forks to mix the eggy cream into the hot pasta. It will cook in the heat of the pasta, coating each strand in a light, creamy sauce. Serve right away, with a final grinding of black pepper on top."},{"vegetarian":false,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":true,"dairyFree":true,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":false,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":8,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":false,"servings":4,"sourceUrl":"http://www.confessionsofanover-workedmom.com/2012/11/mongolian-beef-recipe.html","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/mongolian-beef-482262","aggregateLikes":205,"creditText":"Confessions of an Over Worked Mom","sourceName":"Confessions of an Over Worked Mom","extendedIngredients":[{"id":23572,"aisle":"Frozen","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/beef-cubes-raw.png","name":"beef","amount":8,"unit":"oz","unitShort":"oz","unitLong":"ounces","originalString":"8 oz beef sliced into thin strips","metaInformation":["sliced into thin strips"]},{"id":4582,"aisle":"Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vegetable-oil.jpg","name":"cooking oil","amount":2,"unit":"tablespoons","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoons","originalString":"2 tablespoons cooking oil","metaInformation":[]},{"id":20027,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg","name":"corn starch","amount":1,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoon","originalString":"1 teaspoon corn starch","metaInformation":[]},{"id":11216,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ginger.jpg","name":"fresh ginger","amount":0.5,"unit":"tbsp","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoons","originalString":"½ tbsp chopped fresh ginger","metaInformation":["fresh","chopped"]},{"id":11215,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg","name":"garlic","amount":3,"unit":"cloves","unitShort":"cloves","unitLong":"cloves","originalString":"3 cloves garlic, sliced or chopped thinly","metaInformation":["sliced","chopped"]},{"id":10216124,"aisle":"Condiments","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/soy-sauce.jpg","name":"light soy sauce","amount":1,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoon","originalString":"1 teaspoon light soy sauce","metaInformation":["light"]},{"id":11282,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-onion.jpg","name":"onion","amount":1,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"1 small onion sliced in strips or use leeks or scallions if you prefer","metaInformation":["small","sliced in strips or use leeks or scallions if you prefer"]},{"id":2047,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg","name":"salt","amount":4,"unit":"servings","unitShort":"servings","unitLong":"servings","originalString":"Salt to taste","metaInformation":["to taste"]},{"id":4058,"aisle":"Ethnic Foods","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sesame-oil.jpg","name":"sesame oil","amount":0.25,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"¼ teaspoon sesame oil","metaInformation":[]},{"id":16124,"aisle":"Ethnic Foods","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/soy-sauce.jpg","name":"soy sauce","amount":2,"unit":"tablespoons","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoons","originalString":"2 tablespoons soy sauce","metaInformation":[]},{"id":11583,"aisle":"Frozen","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/mixed-vegetables.png","name":"stir fry vegetables","amount":1,"unit":"bag","unitShort":"bag","unitLong":"bag","originalString":"1 bag of stir fry vegetables","metaInformation":[]},{"id":19335,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg","name":"sugar","amount":1,"unit":"tablespoon","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoon","originalString":"1 tablespoon sugar or to taste","metaInformation":["to taste"]},{"id":14412,"aisle":"Beverages","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/water.jpg","name":"water","amount":1,"unit":"tablespoon","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoon","originalString":"1 tablespoon water","metaInformation":[]}],"id":482262,"title":"Mongolian Beef","readyInMinutes":45,"image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Mongolian-Beef-482262.jpg","imageType":"jpg","cuisines":[],"instructions":"Marinate the beef with the seasonings for 30 minutes.

Sauce","readyInMinutes":45,"image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/BBQ-Turkey-with-Mustard-Sauce-246523.jpg","imageType":"jpg","cuisines":["american"],"instructions":"1 Pat the turkey pieces dry with paper towels.  Salt the turkey pieces well all over.  Let sit at room temperature for 20-30 minutes.2 Make the sauce.  Sauté the onions in butter until soft (but not browned), about 3-4 minutes on medium heat.  Add the other sauce ingredients and simmer slowly, stirring occasionally, for at least 30 minutes. 3 Prepare your grill for high direct heat on one side, and quite low indirect heat on the other side. To do this using a gas grill turn on only half of the burners.  If using a charcoal grill, leave one side of your grill free of coals.  If using a gas grill, preheat covered for at least 15 minutes.3 Rub oil all over the turkey pieces.  Clean the grill grates with a grill grate scraper. Wipe down the grates with a paper towel soaked in oil.  4 Lay the turkey pieces down on the hot grill, skin side down, to get an initial sear on the turkey.  Pay attention because the fat in the turkey may cause flare ups.  If this happens be prepared to move the piece to a cooler side of the grill temporarily, or have a spay bottle of water on hand to douse the flames a bit if they get too high.  Sear the turkey on the skin side for 3-4 minutes.  Once the skin of a piece starts to get browned, move the piece to the cool side of the grill, turning it over so that the skin side is now up.  This way the fat under the skin will melt into the meat, basting it, during the next slow-cooking phase.5 Once you've moved all the turkey to the cool side of the grill, cover the grill and let the turkey slow-cook for 20 minutes without looking. Check every 15-20 minutes after that, because everyone’s grill is different.  The turkey should cook for at least 1 1/2 hours after the initial sear, probably longer. (I think we cooked these  pictured for 2 1/2 hours.) Barbecue by definition must be slow cooking over low heat.6 After about an hour, start to paint the turkey with the barbecue sauce.  Paint only the top part (skin side) to start.  Cover and wait another 20 minutes or so. Then flip the turkey over and paint the undersides.  Why wait? You want the sauce to sink in, adhere to the turkey and solidify a little; this way it will not drip down into the grill as much.  Cover and wait another 15 to 20 minutes.Depending on how big your turkey pieces are, and your specific grill set up, the time it takes for your turkey pieces to be done will vary.  To test for doneness you can insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the thigh, not touching the bone.  Take the turkey off the grill at 170°F to 175°F for thighs and legs, 165°F for breasts.  Or if you don't have a meat thermometer, cut into one of the pieces with a knife. The juices should run clear.  If they run pink, the meat needs to be cooked longer.You can continue to baste with the sauce every 15 minutes or so until the meat is done.7 When the meat is just about ready to take off the grill, you can do a final sear on the skin side.  Just place the pieces skin side down on the hot part of the grill.  Watch it so that it just browns, not burns.  It should take 1-2 minutes.Serve with extra sauce, and plenty of napkins!"},{"vegetarian":false,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":true,"dairyFree":true,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":false,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":3,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":false,"servings":8,"sourceUrl":"http://www.slowcookeradventures.com/2012/07/margarita-chicken.html","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/margarita-chicken-615109","aggregateLikes":20,"extendedIngredients":[{"id":1002014,"aisle":"Spices

and add the butter to a large saucepan over medium high heat.  When the butter is melted add the onion and cook until soft, about 5 minutes.3) Dice the celery, carrots, and hot pepper and add those to the onions along with the cobs from the corn.  Add a pinch of salt and stir.4) Cook for another few minutes until the carrots and celery are soft.5) Turn the heat down to low/medium-low.6) Add the cream, milk, and bay leaves and bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally.  Make sure the dairy isn't burning to the pan at all.  It should take 15 minutes or so to come to a simmer.7) Simmer for 30 minutes.  Depending on how thick you want your soup, you can take the lid off the pot during this.  I simmered for 20 minutes with lid on and 10 minutes with lid off.8) Remove cobs and bay leaf, and add diced potatoes and cook for another 5 minutes until potatoes are soft.9) Add corn, diced peppers, thyme, and taste for salt and pepper.  Simmer for another minute or so and serve immediately.  The corn and peppers should still be slightly

cauliflower: Preheat oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit. Toss cauliflower florets with enough olive oil to cover them in a light, even layer of oil. Season with salt and pepper and arrange the florets in a single layer on a large, rimmed baking sheet. Roast for 30 to 35 minutes, tossing halfway, until the florets are deeply golden on the edges.To cook the freekeh: Warm 1 tablespoon olive oil in a heavy-bottomed saucepan. Add the almonds and cook, stirring occasionally, until it's fragrant and turning golden on the edges, about 3 minutes. Add the freekeh and saut for 2 minutes, then add the garlic, cumin, coriander and salt, and saut for 1 more minute. Add vegetable broth, raise the heat and bring the mixture a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover and cook, stirring occasionally and reducing heat as necessary to maintain a gentle simmer, until freekeh is tender to the bite, 20 to 25 minutes. Drain off any excess liquid, cover and set aside for 5 minutes. Fluff with a fork and season with salt and pepper to taste.To make the dressing: In a bowl, stir together the tahini, lemon juice, garlic and red pepper flakes. Whisk in the water until you have a smooth, blended tahini sauce. Season generously with salt and black pepper, to taste.To assemble the individual dishes: Start with a bed of cooked freekeh and top with roasted cauliflower. Drizzle tahini sauce generously over the dish and then top with a sprinkling of chopped fresh herbs, crumbled feta (optional), raisins and sesame seeds. Serve immediately. Leftovers are best stored as individual components and assembled after reheating the freekeh and cauliflower."},{"vegetarian":false,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":true,"dairyFree":true,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":false,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":6,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":true,"servings":4,"preparationMinutes":15,"cookingMinutes":15,"sourceUrl":"http://www.foodfanatic.com/2014/09/grilled-chimichurri-steaks/","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/grilled-chimichurri-steaks-613381","aggregateLikes":18,"creditText":"Food Fanatic","sourceName":"Food Fanatic","extendedIngredients":[{"id":1002030,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pepper.jpg","name":"black pepper","amount":1,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoon","originalString":"1 teaspoon black pepper","metaInformation":["black"]},{"id":2027,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/oregano.jpg","name":"dried oregano","amount":1,"unit":"tablespoon","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoon","originalString":"1 tablespoon dried oregano","metaInformation":["dried"]},{"id":10017166,"aisle":"Meat","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/whole-chicken.jpg","name":"elk tenderloin","amount":4,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"4 new york strip steaks, you can also used ribeye or tenderloin, too","metaInformation":["canned"]},{"id":11215,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg","name":"garlic","amount":4,"unit":"cloves","unitShort":"cloves","unitLong":"cloves","originalString":"4 cloves garlic, minced","metaInformation":["minced"]},{"id":1082047,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg","name":"kosher salt","amount":2,"unit":"teaspoons","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"2 teaspoons kosher salt","metaInformation":[]},{"id":9152,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/lemon-juice.jpg","name":"lemon juice","amount":2,"unit":"teaspoons","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"2 teaspoons lemon juice","metaInformation":[]},{"id":4053,"aisle":"Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg","name":"olive oil","amount":0.3333333333333333,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"1/3 cup olive oil","metaInformation":[]},{"id":11297,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/parsley.jpg","name":"parsley","amount":1.5,"unit":"cups","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"1 1/2 cups italian parsley, chopped and lightly packed","metaInformation":["italian","packed","chopped"]},{"id":11976,"aisle":"Canned and Jarred","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cubanelle-pepper.jpg","name":"pepperoncini peppers","amount":3,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"3 pepperoncini peppers, stems removed and finely chopped (optional)","metaInformation":["finely chopped"]},{"id":1032009,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/red-pepper-flakes.jpg","name":"red pepper flakes","amount":0.5,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes","metaInformation":["red","crushed"]},{"id":1022068,"aisle":"Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/red-wine-vinegar.jpg","name":"red wine vinegar","amount":0.25,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"1/4 cup red wine vinegar","metaInformation":["red"]}],"id":613381,"title":"Grilled Chimichurri Steaks","readyInMinutes":30,"image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Grilled-Chimichurri-Steaks-613381.jpg","imageType":"jpg","cuisines":["south american","latin american"],"instructions":"Preheat grill to high.Season the steaks with the salt and pepper.

Spoon 1 tablespoon flour into a small baking tray, put the dough in the tray and let sit until the oven is hot. Optional sprinkle salt and  few green onion chopped leaves on top. Put an empty baking pot in the oven ten minutes before baking. As you put the baking tray in the oven, add a cup of hot water in the empty pot, in this way it will instantly boil and create steam. Bake for about 25-30 minutes.

Pat the chicken dry. Cut the chicken into 10 pieces instead of the usual 8. To create the extra two pieces, cut the breast off the backbone, and then cut each breast in half, which will give you two wings, two thighs, two legs, and four pieces of breast. (Editor’s Note: You really must partake of this nifty little trick.) Place the chicken pieces in a large bowl and season with the salt, pepper, cayenne, white pepper, garlic powder, and hot sauce, and toss to coat evenly. Cover with plastic and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to 1 day (the longer the better, to allow the seasonings to permeate the meat).2. Remove the chicken from the dry spices, allowing any liquid to drip back into the bowl, and place the chicken in a clean bowl. Pour the buttermilk over the chicken.3. Heat the lard, vegetable shortening, or bacon fat in a large cast-iron skillet to 350°F (176°C), or until a pinch of flour sizzles when it’s dropped in the fat.4. As the oil heats, remove the chicken from the buttermilk, allowing any excess liquid to drip off, and transfer the chicken to a clean bowl. Sprinkle with the flour and toss to coat.5. When the oil is ready, add the chicken pieces to the skillet in batches, shaking off any excess flour before adding them to the oil. Start with the larger bone-in cuts in the first round, as they will take longer to cook. Then fry the chicken breasts in the second round. For the crispiest results, it’s important not to overcrowd the pan. Fry the first batch of chicken about 8 minutes on each side, using tongs to turn it as necessary, making sure the oil does not get too hot. The oil should have a mellow sizzle, not a raging boil, or it will make the outside of the chicken too dark before the inside is cooked.

Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.Transfer the choux pastry to a large pastry bag fitted with ½-inch plain tip (like Wilton 1A). For larger profiteroles, pipe the paste into 1½-inch rounds, spacing 3 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets. For smaller profiteroles, pipe the paste into 1-inch rounds, about 1 inch in diameter, spacing 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets. To prevent the tops from burning, level the peaks with a wet fingertip.Bake one sheet of profiteroles at a time. Using a small spray bottle filled with water, lightly spritz the profiteroles with water and immediately place in the oven. The water will help to create steam, which helps give the profiteroles volume.Bake until tops and sides are golden, 25 to 30 minutes for larger profiteroles and 15 to 20 minutes for smaller ones. Turn off the oven and allow to rest in the oven for 5 minutes.Remove from the oven. Pierce each profiterole in the side with a small paring knife to allow steam to escape. Transfer to a wire rack and allow to cool completely.With a serrated knife, cut each profiterole in half crosswise.Transfer the chantilly cream to a large piping bag fitted with a large tip (like a Wilton 1M). Pipe the cream in a decorative swirl on the bottom half of each profiteroles. Replace the tops.To serve, dust with confectioners’ sugar. If not serving immediately, filled profiteroles can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to two hours (any longer could cause the pastry to go soggy).Combine the cream and the vanilla bean and seeds in an airtight container. Stir to combine. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour, or preferably 24 hours, to allow the vanilla to infuse.At least 30 minutes before whipping the cream, put the bowl and whip attachment of a stand mixer in the freezer. Just prior to whipping, remove the vanilla cream from the refrigerator and strain through a fine-mesh sieve into the cold bowl (discard the solids).Fit the mixer with the whip attachment and begin beating the cream at high speed (to immediately incorporate air) until soft peaks (curl when attachment is lifted) form, about 2 minutes. Reduce the speed to low and gradually add the confectioners’ sugar. Increase the speed to high and continue beating to stiff peaks (stand up straight when attachment is lifted), about 2 minutes longer.If not using immediately, transfer to an airtight container and refrigerator until ready to use, no longer than 3 hours.In a medium saucepan, bring the water, butter, sugar, and salt to a rolling boil over medium-high heat, stirring gently with a wooden spoon.When the mixture begins to boil, add the flour all at once and stir vigorously until the paste reaches an internal temperature of 175°F (80°C), pulls away from the sides of the pan, and forms a ball, about 1 minute.

In a frying pan over medium-high to high heat, heat about an inch of canola or vegetable oil. Fry each slice of pork until just barely golden brown around the edges, about 1-2 minutes, flipping halfway through. If they are thin enough, this will be enough to cook them fully.

Add enough water to the pot to cover the pork and onions. Cover pot and simmer on medium heat for 45 minutes to 1 hour. Stir occasionally.5.

Set aside.Using a handheld electric mixer or in the bowl of a stand mixer, blend the oil, sugar, and vanilla until well mixed. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in the dry ingredients until just incorporated. The batter will be quite thick. Drain any excess liquid from the apples (if any) and stir the apple mixture into the batter. Don't overmix! Pour the batter evenly into the prepared pan.In a medium bowl, beat the cream cheese just until smooth. Add the 1/3 cup sugar, vanilla and egg and beat on medium speed until creamy and smooth.Using a spoon or butter knife, make a trench in the center of the cake batter (going around in the circular shape of the bundt pan) about 1-inch deep (just scoop the excess batter to either side. Spoon the cream cheese mixture into the trench. Try and keep the cream cheese mixture in a ring in the center of the cake so it has cake batter on either side around the circle. Once the cream cheese mixture is in place, use a butter knife to swirl the cream cheese mixture into the surrounding cake batter.Bake the cake for 1 hour and 15 minutes (checking often as you may need to decrease or increase time based on your pan and exact oven temperature). Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out with only a few moist crumbs.While the cake is cooling, mix the ingredients for the glaze in a small pan over medium high heat. Allow the ingredients to come to a boil and boil for one minute, stirring constantly. Pour the glaze over the cake while the cake is still in the pan. Let the cake cool in the pan before removing. Turn the cake out onto a serving plate and store covered in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. Serve chilled or at room temperature, drizzling caramel sauce over each piece.For the caramel sauce, mix the butter, brown sugar, half-and-half or cream, and salt in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook while whisking gently for 5 to 7 minutes, until thickened slightly. Add the vanilla and cook another minute to thicken further. Turn off the heat and pour the sauce into a jar. Refrigerate until cold (or use slightly warm but not hot). If the caramel sauce has cooled in the fridge long enough to harden, warm slightly before drizzling on cake."},{"vegetarian":false,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":false,"dairyFree":true,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":false,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":30,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":false,"servings":4,"preparationMinutes":150,"cookingMinutes":90,"sourceUrl":"http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchens/beer-brined-beer-can-chicken.html","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/beer-brined-beer-can-chicken-743696","aggregateLikes":355,"creditText":"Foodnetwork","sourceName":"Foodnetwork","extendedIngredients":[{"id":14006,"aisle":"Alcoholic

                                         Make the brine: Combine the beer, brown sugar, salt, orange zest, orange juice and cardamom pods in a bowl; stir until the sugar and salt dissolve.Put the chicken in a gallon-size resealable plastic bag and add the brine; seal and refrigerate 2 hours.Prepare the grill: For a charcoal grill, pile 3 to 4 pounds briquettes in the grill; ignite and let burn until the coals are ashy. For a gas grill, preheat to high.Prepare the chicken: Remove from the brine and pat dry; reserve the orange zest and cardamom. Rub the olive oil all over the skin. Loosen the skin on the breasts and legs with your fingers; rub 1 garlic clove under and over the skin. Combine the brown sugar, coriander, cumin, paprika, allspice, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and a few grinds of pepper; rub under and over the skin of the chicken and inside the cavity.Pour half of the remaining beer can into a disposable 8-inch-square pan. Add the reserved orange zest to the pan. Poke 3 or 4 holes into the top sides of the beer can using a paring knife. Add the remaining 3 smashed garlic cloves and the reserved cardamom pods to the can.For a charcoal grill, bank the coals to both sides in two piles; nestle the pan with the beer between the coals and replace the top grill grate. For a gas grill, reduce the heat to medium on one side and turn off the burners on the other; place the pan under the grate on the unlit side.Set the chicken over the beer can, inserting the can into the cavity so 1 inch of the can is exposed. Set on the grill grates over the drip pan so the chicken balances on the can and legs like a tripod. Cover the grill and cook until the chicken is golden brown and a thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh registers 165 degrees F. If using charcoal, this will take about 1 hour 20 minutes; add a handful of briquettes to each bank of coals every 30 minutes to maintain the heat. If using gas, it will take about 1 hour 5 minutes; carefully rotate the chicken halfway through.Remove the chicken from the grill, discard the can and transfer to a cutting board; let rest 10 minutes before carving.Photograph by Con Poulos                                                    Recipe courtesy of Food Network Magazine                         CATEGORIES:

I do that by adding the eggs to cold water, heating them over medium heat and gradually increasing it to high heat. Once boiling, I boil the eggs for 2 minutes, then I remove them from the heat, cover the pot and let it sit for 10 minutes. I then run the eggs under cold water for a few minutes and let them soak in the cold water until ready to peel.Heat a large skillet over medium heat and add bacon. I think bacon is best when cooked over medium-low heat, as it crisps up evenly. Cook the bacon until all the fat is rendered and then turn off the heat. Place the bacon on a paper towel to slightly drain and cool. Gently pour the bacon fat into a bowl or cup. To assemble the salads, pile your spinach on a plate and cover with the sliced hard boiled eggs, avocado and gorgonzola. Crumble on two slices of bacon and season with a bit of pepper if you'd like. I find that this salad doesn't need a lot of salt since the components are so salty.hot bacon dressingAdd the bacon grease, , minced garlic, vinegar, sugar and mustard to a saucepan over medium-low heat. Whisk constantly until the sugar has dissolved and the dressing slightly emulsifies. Season with the salt and pepper. Before serving, add in the crumbled bacon. You can keep this over low heat while stirring occasionally until ready to serve. I suggest reheating it in a saucepan like so. This is the combo I've come to love over the years, but you can experiment with different vinegars, more bacon fat and other spices too!"},{"vegetarian":true,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":true,"dairyFree":false,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":false,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":3,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":false,"servings":8,"preparationMinutes":10,"cookingMinutes":0,"sourceUrl":"http://cantstayoutofthekitchen.com/2012/08/27/mandarin-spinach-salad/","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/mandarin-spinach-salad-501553","aggregateLikes":144,"creditText":"Can't

Add the hot dogs and cook until heated through, stirring occasionally, 5 minutes. Stir in the hot sauce and cook until the hot dogs are coated, 1 to 2 minutes.Slice vertically through each potato bun, about halfway through so it resembles a top-split hot dog bun, and place 2 buffalo dogs in each.

Set aside.  Add the flour, sugar and salt to the bowl of a food processor.  Pulse a few times to combine.  Add the butter chunks to the food processor and pulse until it resembles coarse meal (and the butter is in even-sized pieces).  Add in the egg mixture and process until the dough just comes together (it should be evenly moistened and clumps together a bit).  Dump the dough onto a piece of plastic wrap and use your hands to pat it together and form into a disc, about 6 inches wide.  Wrap tightly and transfer to the refrigerator for about 1 hour, until firm.On a floured piece of parchment paper, roll out the dough into a circle about 13 inches wide.  If the dough is too sticky, refrigerate until it firms up.  Transfer the dough to a fluted 9-inch tart pan with a removable bottom and press into the edges to fill the sides (if any part of the crust is too thin, use the extra from the top to reinforce the sides).  Remove any excess dough from the top.  Set the pan on a plate or small baking sheet and transfer to the freezer for 30 minutes.Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  When the crust is done freezing, place on a large baking sheet.  Gently line with a piece of foil (large enough to cover the edges) and fill with pie weights.  Bake for 30 minutes, rotating once halfway through.  Carefully remove the foil and weights and then return to the oven to bake for an additional 5 to 7 minutes, until golden brown.  Transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely.  Once cool, remove the crust from the pan and set on a serving plate.  To make the filling - add the heavy cream, mascarpone, vanilla and honey to a large bowl.  Using a hand-mixer, whip on high until it forms soft peaks (this will take a few minutes - alternatively you can also do this in a stand mixer).  Add in the chocolate chips and whip for a few seconds to incorporate.Transfer the filling to the cooled crust and spread evenly.  Top with the strawberries and blueberries (I like to arrange them in a pattern to make it look pretty - with the blueberries in the center and strawberries around the outside!)."},{"vegetarian":true,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":true,"dairyFree":false,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":false,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":7,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":false,"servings":12,"sourceUrl":"http://www.marthastewart.com/319138/savory-autumn-leaf-pies","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/savory-autumn-leaf-pies-20421","aggregateLikes":52,"creditText":"Martha

Remove from the water and lay flat on a baking sheet.Heat up a skillet over medium high heat, and brown the sausage and ground beef until fully cooked.  There should be enough fat in the sausage to prevent sticking, but if you feel you need to, you can add some olive oil before browning the sausage.  Remove the meat from the pan and reserve.Add the smashed garlic cloves to the pan, and saute for 2 minutes.  Remove the garlic, then add the zucchini to the pan. Season with salt and pepper, and a pinch of crushed red pepper flakes.  Cook the zucchini for a few minutes, until tender and soft, but not mushy.  Add a splash of water to the pan, just to remove all the brown bits leftover from the sausage and take them with your zucchini.

Fit the 12 molds of a muffin tin with paper muffin cups. Place on a baking sheet and set aside.                                                                                                                            2                                                                            Make the cupcakes: Whisk together flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Set aside. Working with a stand mixer or a hand mixer and a large bowl, beat the butter at medium speed until soft and creamy. Add the sugar and beat for two minutes, until it is blended into the butter. Add the egg, then the yolk, beating for 1 minute between each addition and scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. Beat in the vanilla, then reduce the mixer speed to low and add half the dry ingredients, mixing only until they disappear. Scrape down the bowl and add the buttermilk, mixing until incorporated, then mix in the remaining dry ingredients. Scrape down the bowl, add the melted chocolate, and mix it in by hand with a rubber spatula. Divide the batter evenly into the prepared molds. Bake for 22 - 25 minutes, or until the tops of the cakes are springy and a tester inserted in the centers comes out clean. Transfer the muffin pan to a cooling rack and allow the cakes to cool for 5 minutes before unmolding them. Cool to room temperature before glazing.                                                                                                                            3                                                                            Make the glaze: Melt the chocolate in a heatproof bowl over a saucepan of simmering water.Transfer the bowl to the counter and allow it to sit for five minutes. Stir in sifted confectioner's sugar, followed by pieces of cold butter. Stir until the butter completely disappears into the chocolate. Use a small spatula to spread the glaze on the cupcakes or dip them if the glaze seems very thin (if you'd prefer, allow the glaze to cool more, then spread.)"},{"vegetarian":false,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":true,"dairyFree":true,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":false,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":29,"gaps":"GAPS_5","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":true,"servings":4,"preparationMinutes":8,"cookingMinutes":7,"sourceUrl":"http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Rocks-T-Bone-Steaks/","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/rocks-t-bone-steaks-464724","aggregateLikes":313,"creditText":"Allrecipes","sourceName":"Allrecipes","extendedIngredients":[{"id":2031,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chili-powder.jpg","name":"cayenne pepper","amount":0.75,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"3/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste","metaInformation":["to taste"]},{"id":1022020,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic-powder.jpg","name":"garlic powder","amount":0.75,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"3/4 teaspoon garlic powder, or to taste","metaInformation":["to taste"]},{"id":2012,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ground-coriander.jpg","name":"ground coriander","amount":0.75,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"3/4 teaspoon ground coriander, or to taste","metaInformation":["to taste"]},{"id":1002030,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pepper.jpg","name":"ground pepper","amount":1.5,"unit":"teaspoons","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"1 1/2 teaspoons ground black pepper","metaInformation":["black"]},{"id":2043,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/turmeric.jpg","name":"ground turmeric","amount":0.75,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"3/4 teaspoon ground turmeric, or to taste","metaInformation":["to taste"]},{"id":2026,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/onion-powder.jpg","name":"onion powder","amount":0.75,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"3/4 teaspoon onion powder","metaInformation":[]},{"id":2028,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chili-powder.jpg","name":"paprika","amount":2,"unit":"teaspoons","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"2 teaspoons paprika","metaInformation":[]},{"id":2047,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg","name":"salt","amount":4,"unit":"teaspoons","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"4 teaspoons salt, or to taste","metaInformation":["to taste"]},{"id":23003,"aisle":"Meat","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/tbone-or-porterhouse-raw.jpg","name":"t-bone steaks","amount":64,"unit":"ounce","unitShort":"oz","unitLong":"ounces","originalString":"4 (16 ounce) t-bone steaks, at room temperature","metaInformation":["at room temperature"]}],"id":464724,"title":"Rock's T-Bone Steaks","readyInMinutes":15,"image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Rocks-T-Bone-Steaks-464724.jpg","imageType":"jpg","cuisines":[],"instructions":"Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil the grate.

chicken into bite-size pieces. Beat together the egg white and 1 tbsp cornflour in a bowl. Tip in the chicken and coat with the mix (see Know-how, top right). Marinate for 15-30 mins (don’t place in the fridge or the mix will harden). Now rinse the rice in a sieve under the cold tap until the water runs clear.Making perfect rice: Drain the rice,tip into a pan with a lid and pour over600ml water and a pinch of salt. Bring thewater to the boil, then cook the rice uncoveredfor 10 mins or so until the water has almostboiled away and small craters appear. Coverwith a lid, turn the heat down as low as itwill go and cook for 10 mins more.Getting the ingredients ready: Strip the ginger skin with a teaspoon and finely chop until you have 1 tbsp. Halve the pepper and trim off the stalk, inner pith and seeds. Cut into bite-size pieces. Peel theshallot and garlic clove, then thinly slice. Trim the ends off the chilli, if using, removing the seeds if you like it milder, and cut into thin slices. Remove the chicken from the eggmarinade and pat dry with kitchen paper.Foolproof stir-frying: Heat a wok and pour in 1 tbsp oil. Cook the chicken for 7-10 mins, tossing until just cooked. Set aside. Pour in some more oil if you need to. Add the pepper and cook for 1 min, then cook the ginger, shallot and garlic for 1-2 mins more. Combine the fish sauce, lime juice, 50ml water and 1 tsp cornflour. Tip into the wok, then add the chicken. Cook for 1 min, stir through the basil, then serve with the rice."},{"vegetarian":false,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":false,"dairyFree":false,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":false,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":19,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":false,"servings":4,"preparationMinutes":10,"cookingMinutes":35,"sourceUrl":"http://www.lifesambrosia.com/2015/11/sausage-pesto-pizza-recipe.html","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/sausage-pesto-pizza-691100","aggregateLikes":160,"creditText":"Lifes Ambrosia","sourceName":"Lifes Ambrosia","extendedIngredients":[{"id":10011693,"aisle":"Canned and Jarred","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/tomatoes-canned.jpg","name":"canned tomatoes","amount":15,"unit":"ounce","unitShort":"oz","unitLong":"ounces","originalString":"1 (15 ounce) can diced tomatoes, drained","metaInformation":["diced","drained","canned"]},{"id":1032009,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/red-pepper-flakes.jpg","name":"crushed red pepper","amount":0.25,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper","metaInformation":["red","crushed"]},{"id":11215,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg","name":"garlic cloves","amount":2,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"2 garlic cloves, minced","metaInformation":["minced"]},{"id":7063,"aisle":"Meat","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/raw-pork-sausage.jpg","name":"ground sausage","amount":0.5,"unit":"pound","unitShort":"lb","unitLong":"pounds","originalString":"1/2 pound ground Italian sausage","metaInformation":["italian"]},{"id":1026,"aisle":"Cheese","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/mozzarella-fresh.jpg","name":"mozzarella","amount":1,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cup","originalString":"1 cup diced mozzarella (1/2 inch pieces)","metaInformation":["diced","(1/2 inch pieces)"]},{"id":4053,"aisle":"Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg","name":"olive oil","amount":1,"unit":"tablespoon","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoon","originalString":"1 tablespoon olive oil","metaInformation":[]},{"id":93698,"aisle":"Pasta and Rice","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pesto.jpg","name":"pesto","amount":0.25,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"1/4 cup pesto","metaInformation":[]},{"id":93610,"aisle":"Refrigerated","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pizza-dough.jpg","name":"pizza dough","amount":1,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"1 homemade or store-bought pizza dough","metaInformation":["homemade","store-bought"]},{"id":2047,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg","name":"salt","amount":0.5,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"1/2 teaspoon salt","metaInformation":[]}],"id":691100,"title":"Sausage Pesto Pizza","readyInMinutes":45,"image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/sausage-pesto-pizza-691100.jpg","imageType":"jpg","cuisines":["mediterranean","european","italian"],"instructions":"Preheat oven to 430 degrees.

Add another tablespoon of olive oil and brown the beef on both sides. Remove from pot and cut into several pieces - allows for quicker fall-apart tender results.Return beef, including the bone and marrow to the pot. Add Guinness, tomatoes, onions, carrots, cinnamon, and bay leaf to pot. Cover and simmer on low for 3-4 hours until beef is to desired tenderness. Alternatively, you may transfer to a slow cooker and cook 6-8 hours on Low.While stew is cooking, peel and boil the potatoes for mashed potatoes. Prepare your favorite mashed potatoes. Prepare frozen peas according to package directions.

to 400 degrees F.Use a fork to poke sweet potato several times. Place sweet potato on a small plan lined with foil and bake in the oven for 30-45 minutes or until fork tender.While sweet potato is cooking, cook the wild rice by adding 1 cup water and wild rice to a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil, then cover, reduce heat to low and simmer for 30-40 minutes or until tender.Add cooked sweet potato (not the skin) and chickpeas to a large bowl; mash with a fork or potato masher. (Alternatively you can use a food processor and pulse them until somewhat, but not completely smooth.) Next stir in cooked wild rice, curry powder, cumin and garlic powder. Add salt and pepper to taste. Then stir in breadcrumbs (or oat flour), cranberries and pecans, if using. The pecans add a lovely flavor, but aren't necessary. Shape mixture into six patties. It's easier to shape and cook the patties when they are cold, so if you'd like you can keep the mixture in the fridge until cold then form patties (I recommend doing it this way!).Heat coconut oil over medium heat in a large pan. Once oil is hot, add patties and cook for about 7-9 minutes, then VERY carefully flip. Cook for an additional 7-9 minutes on the other side, adding more oil to the pan if necessary. Serve on their own or in a bun! I love mine with avocado & arugula.

Add almond flour and mix until combined.Whisk 1 tablespoon of water into the remaining tablespoon or so of egg white and set aside.Pour sliced almonds onto a shallow dish or plate. Divide dough into 6 even balls (approximately 50 grams each, if you want to be extra accurate. A large, 3 tablespoon size cookie scoop is just about the perfect size). Drop one ball onto the sliced almonds. Roll, using the almonds to prevent the dough from sticking to your hands, into a 4-inch log. Transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet, and gently shape into a crescent, pressing down to flatten slightly. Repeat with remaining dough.Preheat your oven to 375 degrees F. Let cookies sit, uncovered, for 30 minutes, then brush with egg white mixture. Bake for 15 to 18 minutes or until bottoms are golden brown. Remove from oven and let cool on cookie sheet while you prepare the glaze.In a small saucepan, combine cream, butter, and corn syrup. Stir over medium-low heat until melted and smooth. Remove from heat and add chopped chocolate; the residual heat should be enough to fully melt the chocolate. If not, return to low heat for a minute at a time until mixture is smooth.Remove from heat and quickly dip cooled cookies into glaze. You can either dip one half, as I did, or you can dip both dips. Return to baking sheet and let sit for 30 minutes until glaze is set. If you have extra glaze, it makes a great ice cream topping. Or better yet, use it to dip some fresh strawberries.Cookies will keep, covered in an airtight container, for up to 1 week."},{"vegetarian":false,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":false,"dairyFree":true,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":false,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":22,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":false,"servings":4,"preparationMinutes":20,"cookingMinutes":0,"sourceUrl":"http://divascancook.com/bacon-cheddar-ranch-pasta-salad-recipe-creamy-cold/","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/bacon-cheddar-ranch-pasta-salad-625295","aggregateLikes":98,"creditText":"Divas Can Cook","sourceName":"Divas Can Cook","extendedIngredients":[{"id":10123,"aisle":"Meat","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/raw-bacon.jpg","name":"bacon","amount":6,"unit":"slices","unitShort":"slices","unitLong":"slices","originalString":"6 slices cooked bacon, diced","metaInformation":["diced","cooked"]},{"id":1059195,"aisle":"Canned and Jarred","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/black-olives.jpg","name":"black olives","amount":0.3333333333333333,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"1/3 cup black olives","metaInformation":["black"]},{"id":10120420,"aisle":"Pasta and Rice","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/farfalle.png","name":"bow-tie pasta","amount":3,"unit":"cups","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"3 cups bow-tie pasta, uncooked","metaInformation":["uncooked"]},{"id":11215,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg","name":"garlic","amount":1,"unit":"clove","unitShort":"clove","unitLong":"clove","originalString":"1 clove garlic, minced","metaInformation":["minced"]},{"id":4025,"aisle":"Condiments","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/mayonnaise.jpg","name":"mayonnaise","amount":0.5,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"½ cup mayonnaise (I used Dukes)","metaInformation":["(I used Dukes)"]},{"id":2027,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/oregano.jpg","name":"oregano","amount":0.5,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"½-1 teaspoon oregano","metaInformation":[]},{"id":4639,"aisle":"Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ranch-dressing.jpg","name":"ranch dressing","amount":0.5,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"½ cup creamy ranch dressing","metaInformation":[]},{"id":11529,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/tomatoes-canned.jpg","name":"tomatoes","amount":2,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"2-3 small tomatoes, seeded & diced","metaInformation":["diced","small","seeded"]}],"id":625295,"title":"Bacon Cheddar Ranch Pasta Salad","readyInMinutes":20,"image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Bacon-Cheddar-Ranch-Pasta-Salad-625295.jpg","imageType":"jpg","cuisines":[],"instructions":"Cook pasta until al dente.

(I totally made a mistake and only used 1 stick of butter.  The recipe was great, but would have been even better with that extra stick.  Oops.)Put the dry ingredients in a bowl and whisk together.I cannot stress enough what a difference freshly grated nutmeg makes.Add the eggs one at a time.  Look very serious while your sister is adding the eggs.  Serious = adorable.Add the applesauce.Mix it all together.Add in the dry ingredients.  Fold in the nuts by hand.  Put the cupcake batter into lined muffin tins.  We used red liners to make them look even more like apples.  Bake in a preheated 350 degree oven for 18 to 20 minutes.Beat the cream cheese and butter until light and fluffy.  Add the brown sugar and beat until combined.Now that I am thinking about it, a sprinkle of cinnamon in that frosting would have been a really good idea.Using a sharp knife or a cookie cutter, cut some leaf shapes out of the Fruit Roll Up.Frost the cupcake with the Brown Sugar Buttercream.Sprinkle the red sanding sugar generously on the cupcake.  (I think that it works better to dip the cupcake in the sugar, it covers the cupcake better that way.)

                                                       Combine the stock and halved garlic head in a big saucepan and simmer for about 15 minutes to give the stock a nice, garlicky taste; strain out the garlic. Keep warm.Bring a pot of salted water to boil for the rigatoni.Pour 1/4 cup olive oil in a large saucepan. Add the sage, rosemary and thyme and warm the oil over medium heat to infuse it with the flavor of the herbs, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the sausage and cook, breaking up the sausage with the side of a big spoon until well browned. Chop the carrots, celery, and onion in a food processor. Add to the saucepan and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, until the vegetables are softened but not browned.To the pan with the sausage stir in the crushed tomatoes, bay leaf, cannelloni beans, and chicken stock. Bring to a simmer and cook for 15 minutes stirring occasionally.Cook the rigatoni in the boiling water for 6 minutes; it should be slightly underdone. Drain and stir into the simmering soup. Add the parsley, and salt and coarsely ground black pepper, to taste. Discard the bay leaf and herb sprigs.To serve, preheat the broiler. Put the baguette slices in a single layer on a baking sheet. Sprinkle with the Parmigiano and broil until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown, about 3 minutes. Ladle the soup into bowls and float a couple of the baguette slices on top.

In a small bowl, pour in milk and 2 tbsp of fruity pebbles. Gently push the fruity pebbles until they are completely soaked in the milk. Heat your cereal up for about 20 seconds. Drain out cereal with a strainer.You should be left with 3 tbsp or slightly over 3 tbsp of cereal milk.2. Take 3 tbsp of the cereal milk and addinto a microwave safe mug. This cake is about the size of a cupcake so your mug should hold at least 8 oz of liquid. If your mug is much bigger, that is fine, but your cake won't rise as high in your mug. Add in flour, sugar, baking powder and oil. Using a mini whisk, mix until batter is completely smooth and no flour lumps remain.3. Stir in 1 tsp of fruit pebbles. Sprinkle additional 1 tsp of fruity pebbles over top of cake. Cook cake in microwave for about 1 minute at full power. Let cool a few minutes before eating.*You can use other types of cereal, but if you use less sugary cereals, you may need to add more sugar to the batter, or if you use more sugary cereals, you might want to reduce the amount of sugar added to the batter. Also, different cereals may yield different taste results. I found that fruity pebbles quickly changed the milk to a fruity pebbles flavored milk without having to let it soak too long and had a prominent flavor you can taste in the cake."},{"vegetarian":false,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":true,"dairyFree":false,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":false,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":12,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":false,"servings":2,"sourceUrl":"http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2011/12/smoked-salmon-with-shrimp-horseradish-cream-and-lime-vinaigrette.html","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/smoked-salmon-with-shrimp-horseradish-cream-and-lime-vinaigrette-200614","aggregateLikes":14,"creditText":"Serious Eats","sourceName":"Serious Eats","extendedIngredients":[{"id":1001056,"aisle":"Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sour-cream.jpg","name":"creme fraiche","amount":2,"unit":"tablespoons","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoons","originalString":"2 tablespoons crème fraiche","metaInformation":[]},{"id":11216,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ginger.jpg","name":"fresh ginger","amount":1,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoon","originalString":"1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger","metaInformation":["fresh","grated"]},{"id":19296,"aisle":"Nut butters, Jams, and Honey","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/honey.jpg","name":"honey","amount":2,"unit":"teaspoons","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"2 teaspoons honey","metaInformation":[]},{"id":2055,"aisle":"Condiments","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/horseradish-sauce.jpg","name":"horseradish sauce","amount":2,"unit":"teaspoons","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"2 teaspoons horseradish sauce","metaInformation":[]},{"id":11252,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/iceberg-lettuce.jpg","name":"lettuce","amount":4,"unit":"handfuls","unitShort":"handfuls","unitLong":"handfuls","originalString":"4 handfuls small leaf lettuce","metaInformation":["small"]},{"id":9159,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/lime-wedge.jpg","name":"limes","amount":2,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"2 limes","metaInformation":[]},{"id":4053,"aisle":"Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg","name":"olive oil","amount":4,"unit":"tablespoons","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoons","originalString":"4 tablespoons olive oil","metaInformation":[]},{"id":2047,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg","name":"salt and pepper","amount":2,"unit":"servings","unitShort":"servings","unitLong":"servings","originalString":"salt and pepper","metaInformation":[]},{"id":15152,"aisle":"Seafood","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/shrimp.jpg","name":"shrimp","amount":20,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"20 large shrimp, with shells on","metaInformation":["with shells on","large"]},{"id":15077,"aisle":"Seafood","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/smoked-salmon.jpg","name":"smoked salmon","amount":4,"unit":"ounces","unitShort":"oz","unitLong":"ounces","originalString":"4 ounces thinly sliced smoked salmon","metaInformation":["smoked","thinly sliced"]}],"id":200614,"title":"Smoked Salmon with Shrimp, Horseradish Cream and Lime Vinaigrette","readyInMinutes":30,"image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Smoked-Salmon-with-Shrimp--Horseradish-Cream-and-Lime-Vinaigrette-200614.jpg","imageType":"jpg","cuisines":[],"instructions":"Procedures                                                                              1                                                                            Bring a large pot of water to a boil.

Beat on high speed for 3 minutes. Stir in lemon zest and as much of the remaining flour as you can.3 Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead in enough of the remaining flour to make a moderately soft dough that is smooth and elastic (3 to 5 minutes total). Place dough in a lightly greased bowl, turning once to grease the surface. Cover; let rise in a warm place until double in size (for 1 to 1-1/2 hours).4 If you are making the poppy seed filling from scratch, combine the filling ingredients in a saucepan.  Cook over low heat until it thickens, stirring often. Set filling aside to cool.5  Punch dough down. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Divide dough in half. Cover; let rest 10 minutes. Grease 2 baking sheets. 6 Roll each dough half into a 16x8 inch rectangle, about an 1/8 inch thick.  Cut each rectangle into 8 4x4 squares.  Place a large, heaping tablespoon of poppy seed filling onto the center of each square.  If you want, add a few raisins to the top of the filling.  Brush the four corners of each square with water.  Draw the corners up and gently press together.  Secure with a toothpick. Place on well greased baking sheets, 2 inches apart.

Wrap the sandwich tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes and up to 6 hours. (Wrapping compacts the sandwich and prevents the egg batter from seeping in.)    Combine the eggs, milk, nutmeg, and salt in a shallow dish. Spread crushed cornflakes in a second shallow dish and coat with cooking spray.

Latkes","readyInMinutes":75,"image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/potato-latkes-344248.jpeg","imageType":"jpeg","cuisines":["jewish"],"instructions":"Directions                                                        Peel the potatoes and shred them in a food processor fitted with the shredding blade; transfer the potatoes to a large bowl as the food processor fills up. Repeat with the onion. Transfer the onion to the bowl with the potatoes and stir in the matzo meal, egg, baking powder and salt.Fill a large skillet with 1/2 inch oil. Heat over medium-high heat until the oil is very hot but not smoking. To test if the oil is hot enough, drop a small piece of potato into the oil; if the potato sizzles steadily, the oil is ready.Working in batches, scoop the potato mixture by 1/4-cupfuls and add them carefully to the skillet, flattening each latke slightly with a spatula. Fry, turning the latkes once, until golden brown and cooked through, about 3 minutes. Drain on paper towels. Remove any loose bits of potato mixture between batches with a slotted spoon.Serve the latkes immediately, or keep them warm in a 200 degree F oven. Garnish with fresh herbs and serve with sour cream and Spiced Apple-Pear Sauce.Cook's Note: If you need to fry a lot of latkes, it's best to make multiple batches rather than one double batch. The longer the mixture sits, the wetter it becomes which makes the latkes fall apart more easily as they cook.                                                Spiced Apple-Pear Sauce:                                        Combine the apples, pears, lemon juice, cinnamon sticks, nutmeg, 1 tablespoon sugar and 1/4 cup water in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Cover, reduce the heat to medium-low and cook until the apples and pears are very soft but still a bit chunky, 15 to 20 minutes. Taste the mixture and add the remaining tablespoon of sugar if desired.Remove the sauce from the heat and stir a few times until the sauce is well combined with small chunks. Cool to room temperature. Remove the cinnamon sticks and serve. (For a smoother sauce, remove from heat, remove the cinnamon sticks and then whisk the mixture until smooth before cooling.)                                                            Cook's Note: This recipe can be prepared several days in advance and refrigerated in an airtight container. Let it stand at room temperature for a few hours before serving.

Continue stirring vigorously until the dough is no longer sticky and a film forms on the bottom of the pan.Stir enthusiastically for another minute or so, until the dough is smooth and glossy. This is an important step because if the batter is too loose when you begin incorporating the eggs, the dough will not puff properly come baking time.Transfer to a bowl and allow the dough to cool for 1-2 minutes. Add the eggs, one a time, fully incorporating each one before adding another. Scrape down the bowl each time and check the consistency of the paste. It should be stiff enough to stand, but soft enough to spread. Add the cheese and nutmeg (if using) and stir to combine.Using an ice cream scoop, two spoons, or piping bag fitted with a wide round tip, drop tablespoon-sized dollops of the paste onto prepared baking sheets. Using damp fingers, press down any irregularities in the shape and form a small ball.Bake for 15 minutes; rotate the pans from front-to-back and top-to-bottom, then reduce the heat to 375 and cook for

of a food processor combine the flour, cornmeal, salt and pepper. Pulse once or twice to combine. Add the diced butter and pulse until you end up with small pieces of butter, similar to the size of rice. Add 1/4 cup ice water to the dough and pulse until it comes together. If needed add 1-2 tablespoons more ice water until the dough comes together. Turn the dough onto a floured work surface, knead a couple of times and then form the dough into a flat disk. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.Meanwhile, add the butter to a skillet set over medium-high heat. Add the onions and 1/4 teaspoon each of salt and pepper. Cook, stirring constantly, until the onions begin to soften, about 5 minutes. Continue to cook, scraping the browned bits off the bottom of the pan frequently until the onions are golden brown, about 20 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the thyme. Season lightly with salt and pepper.Now grab your dough from the fridge. Flour your work surface and roll the dough to about 1/8-inch thickness. Transfer to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.Crumble the blue cheese over the bottom of the dough leaving a 3-inch border around the edges. Sprinkle on the shredded cheddar. Add the caramelized onions in an even layer and then layer on the zucchini, sprinkling it with salt + pepper. Now add the tomato slices and half of the cherry tomatoes, reserving the remaining half for topping. Drizzle the tomatoes with olive oil, sprinkle with salt and pepper. Now drizzle lightly with a little honey. Fold the edge of the dough over the tomatoes. Brush the crust with the beaten egg. Place the galette in the fridge for 15 minutes or until ready to bake.Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.Bake the galette for 45-55 minutes or until the crust is golden and the tomatoes are very lightly charred. Allow to cool 5 minutes and then slice and serve topped with fresh cherry tomatoes and a drizzle of honey, if desired. The crust will be crumbly so cut small slices for easier

425 Fahrenheit.Cut the squash in 2 halves, scrape out the seeds and the fiber out of each half. Spray oil over the cut sides of the squash. Spray the baking sheet with oil and place the squash on the baking sheet cut side down.Bake for about 30-40 minutes. Remove it from the oven when it's cooked through and soft, and let it cool. Flip the squash so that cut side faces up  that will speed up the cooling. After squash cools, scrape squash with a fork to remove flesh in long strands and transfer to a bowl. Let it cool.Important:  Wring out the spaghetti squash by wrapping portions of it in paper towels and squeezing hard with your hands over the sink.  Be careful not to drop the spaghetti squash into the sink if the paper towel breaks. Try to get rid of as much liquid as you can.Cooked spaghetti squash can be refrigerated for 5 days.  I prefer to cook spaghetti squash, refrigerate it and make fritters the next day or 2 days later - that allows spaghetti squash to drain the liquid out and get dryer, which is preferable for frittersIn a large bowl, using electric mixer, beat 2 eggs on high speed for 1-2 minutes.  Add flour and continue beating for about 30 seconds to combine.  To the same bowl, add spaghetti squash, Parmesan cheese, 3 chopped green onions, and 1/4 + 1/8 teaspoons salt.  Mix very well until all the mixture has uniform consistency.  Add chopped bacon and mix.  Taste and adjust seasoning, if necessary, even though it should be just perfect.Heat a large skillet on high-medium heat until VERY hot.  Only then add olive oil.  It should sizzle and smoke right away.  Using a tablespoon, spoon the tablespoon-ful of the batter for each fritter and drop on the skillet.  Using a spatula, correct the shape of each fritter, making it flatter and rounder.   Cook until the bottom side of each fritter is golden brown, about 1-2 minutes.  Reduce heat to medium.  Using spatula, flip fritters to the opposite side, and cook 1-2 more minutes.  When flipping the fritters, you can use a spoon on the opposite side of spatula to help push each fritter onto the spatula and then flipping.   Turn off the heat and let the fritters sit in the skillet (uncovered) for 2-3 more minutes (check the bottom to make sure it's not burned - if it is too dark, remove fritters from the skillet immediately).  Do 4 fritters at a time, you should have a total of 2 batches (8 fritters total).Serve as is, or top with the dollop of Greek yogurt and chopped green onions (delicious if served this way!)."},{"vegetarian":false,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":true,"dairyFree":false,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":true,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":13,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":false,"servings":4,"sourceUrl":"http://www.foodiecrush.com/2013/10/tabasco-brined-spicy-drumsticks/","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/tabasco-brined-spicy-drumsticks-532616","aggregateLikes":1079,"creditText":"Foodie Crush","sourceName":"Foodie Crush","extendedIngredients":[{"id":1001004,"aisle":"Cheese","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/blue-cheese.png","name":"blue cheese crumbles","amount":1,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cup","originalString":"1 cup blue cheese crumbles","metaInformation":[]},{"id":4582,"aisle":"Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vegetable-oil.jpg","name":"canola oil","amount":1.5,"unit":"tablespoons","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoons","originalString":"1 1/2 tablespoons canola oil","metaInformation":[]},{"id":5066,"aisle":"Meat","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chicken-drumsticks.jpg","name":"chicken drumsticks","amount":10,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"10-12 chicken drumsticks","metaInformation":[]},{"id":11291,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/green-onion.jpg","name":"green onion","amount":1,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"1 green onion, chopped for garnish","metaInformation":["green","chopped","for garnish"]},{"id":1082047,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg","name":"kosher salt","amount":0.5,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"½ cup kosher salt","metaInformation":[]},{"id":1082047,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg","name":"kosher salt","amount":4,"unit":"servings","unitShort":"servings","unitLong":"servings","originalString":"kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper","metaInformation":["black","freshly ground"]},{"id":6168,"aisle":"Condiments","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/hot-sauce-or-tabasco.png","name":"tabasco sauce","amount":4,"unit":"tablespoons","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoons","originalString":"4 tablespoons Tabasco Original Red Sauce, plus 10 shakes","metaInformation":["red"]},{"id":14412,"aisle":"Beverages","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/water.jpg","name":"water","amount":1,"unit":"gallon","unitShort":"gallon","unitLong":"gallon","originalString":"1 gallon water","metaInformation":[]}],"id":532616,"title":"Tabasco Brined Spicy Drumsticks","readyInMinutes":45,"image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Tabasco-Brined-Spicy-Drumsticks-532616.jpg","imageType":"jpg","cuisines":[],"instructions":"Mix the water, kosher salt and the 4 tablespoons of Tabasco in a large bowl or stockpot fitted with a lid.

Babka","readyInMinutes":755,"image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/polish-babka-723554.jpg","imageType":"jpg","cuisines":[],"instructions":"Make the Biga pre-fermentation the day before by combining the flour, yeast and water. Mix by hand or with a stand mixer with a dough hook to form a dough that sticks a little to the bottom while mixing. Add more water or flour to achieve that consistency. Place in an oiled covered bowl and set in a warm place for an hour or two until doubled in size. Punch down, cover and place in the refrigerator overnight.Four to five hours before serving, remove Biga from the refrigerator and cut into golf ball sized pieces and lay out on your counter. Cover with plastic and a towel and let come up to room temperature for 45 minutes.While Biga is coming to room temperature, measure out all of your ingredients and prepare milk and butter by combining in a microwave safe bowl and microwaving until hot and the butter has melted. Set aside to cool to room temperature.In a small bowl, combine water and yeast.In a medium bowl, combine eggs, egg yolks, sugar and salt. Using an electric mixer or by hand whip for about three minutes or until the mixture turns pale.To the egg mixture, add nutmeg, both extracts, both zests and orange liquor and stir to combine.Place all six cups of flour on your counter and make a large well in the center.Mix and stir as you go and add each of the three bowls a little at a time starting with warm yeast and water, then cooled milk and butter and finally eggs and sugar mixture, pulling the sides into the center over and over to form a dough.Add the pieces of Biga to the dough working them in as you press and turn. This process will take a good five minutes working the dough to completely blend together. (If using a 6 or 7 quart stand mixer, the process will take less time).The dough now needs to be kneaded for five additional minutes. Pull the back of the dough to the front and press with the heel of your palm over and over working the dough for five minutes. This step is necessary.Oil a large bowl and place the dough ball in and swirl to coat all sides with oil.Cover with plastic and a towel and place in a warm place for at least two hours or until doubled in size.In a medium bowl place both raisins, currants and rum, cover and microwave one minute on high. Set aside covered at room temperature.Once the dough has doubled in size, generously flour your counter and pour out the dough. Cut into three equal pieces, about 1  pounds each.One at a time, roll out each piece of dough to 9 inches wide by 13 inches long.Divide the raisin mixture into thirds and place one third over the rolled out dough bringing it right to the sides. Discard any liquid in the bowl, if any.Do the same for the chopped nuts; dividing in thirds and sprinkling to the edges.Take the long end and roll tightly towards the center. Take the other long end and do the same so that both rolls end in the center.Gently lift and place in a loaf pan, seam side up.Brush a little water between the seam and pinch together to seal.Repeat this procedure for the other two loaves.Cover with plastic and a dish towel and let proof for 90 minutes or until almost doubled in size.Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.Beat the egg with the water and brush the tops of each loaf, trying not to let the egg wash leak down the sides.Place all three in the center of the oven and bake for 30-35 minutes or until golden brown and when tapped, sounds hollow. Half way through baking, rotate pans so that they brown evenly. Ours took 33 minutes.Cool for a few minutes on a rack then invert out of the pan and cool.Once cool, bread should be tightly wrapped. Can be frozen if baking ahead."},{"vegetarian":false,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":true,"dairyFree":true,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":true,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":4,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":false,"servings":4,"preparationMinutes":25,"cookingMinutes":3,"sourceUrl":"http://www.recipegirl.com/2007/06/03/sweet-spicy-chicken-lettuce-wraps/","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/sweet-spicy-chicken-lettuce-wraps-517963","aggregateLikes":12881,"creditText":"Recipe Girl","sourceName":"Recipe Girl","extendedIngredients":[{"id":10011250,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/Butter-or-Boston-Bibb-lettuce.jpg","name":"bibb lettuce leaves","amount":12,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"12 Bibb/Butter lettuce leaves","metaInformation":[]},{"id":11109,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cabbage.jpg","name":"cabbage","amount":2,"unit":"cups","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"2 cups thinly sliced cabbage","metaInformation":["thinly sliced"]},{"id":11590,"aisle":"Ethnic Foods","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/water-chestnuts.jpg","name":"canned water chestnuts","amount":1,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cup","originalString":"1 cup canned, sliced water chestnuts, drained","metaInformation":["canned","drained","sliced"]},{"id":11124,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/carrots.jpg","name":"carrot","amount":0.5,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"1/2 cup grated carrot","metaInformation":["grated"]},{"id":5062,"aisle":"Meat","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chicken-breasts.jpg","name":"chicken breast","amount":1,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cup","originalString":"1 cup finely diced cooked chicken breast","metaInformation":["diced","cooked","finely"]},{"id":2048,"aisle":"Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/apple-cider-vinegar.jpg","name":"cider vinegar","amount":2,"unit":"Tablespoons","unitShort":"Tablespoons","unitLong":"Tablespoons","originalString":"2 Tablespoons cider vinegar","metaInformation":[]},{"id":1032009,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/red-pepper-flakes.jpg","name":"crushed red pepper","amount":0.5,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper","metaInformation":["red","crushed"]},{"id":1004058,"aisle":"Ethnic Foods","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sesame-oil.jpg","name":"dark sesame oil","amount":1,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoon","originalString":"1 teaspoon dark sesame oil","metaInformation":["dark"]},{"id":16090,"aisle":"Nuts","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/peanuts.png","name":"dry roasted peanuts","amount":3,"unit":"Tablespoons","unitShort":"Tablespoons","unitLong":"Tablespoons","originalString":"3 Tablespoons unsalted, dry-roasted peanuts, roughly chopped","metaInformation":["unsalted","roughly chopped"]},{"id":11216,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ginger.jpg","name":"fresh ginger","amount":1,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoon","originalString":"1 teaspoon fresh minced ginger","metaInformation":["fresh","minced"]},{"id":11215,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg","name":"garlic","amount":0.5,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"1/2 teaspoon minced garlic","metaInformation":["minced"]},{"id":6175,"aisle":"Ethnic Foods","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/dark-sauce.jpg","name":"hoisin sauce","amount":3,"unit":"Tablespoons","unitShort":"Tablespoons","unitLong":"Tablespoons","originalString":"3 Tablespoons hoisin sauce","metaInformation":[]},{"id":16424,"aisle":"Condiments","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/soy-sauce.jpg","name":"low sodium soy sauce","amount":2,"unit":"teaspoons","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"2 teaspoons low-sodium soy sauce","metaInformation":["low-sodium"]}],"id":517963,"title":"Sweet & Spicy Chicken Lettuce Wraps","readyInMinutes":28,"image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Sweet---Spicy-Chicken-Lettuce-Wraps-517963.jpg","imageType":"jpg","cuisines":[],"instructions":"1.

Drizzle with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and then wrap the beets in the first layer of foil. Transfer the baking sheet to the oven and roast until the beets are fork tender, about 1 hour.Meanwhile, place shallots in a small bowl, drizzle with another 2 tablespoons of the olive oil, and sprinkle with salt and pepper; toss well. After the beets have roasted for 45 minutes, remove the baking sheet from the oven and carefully place the shallots directly on the second layer of aluminum foil. Return to the oven for another 15 minutes, until the shallots are caramelized and soft and the beets are fully cooked.Let the beets cool in the foil for at least 5 minutes. Transfer the shallots to a large bowl and set aside. When the beets are cool enough to handle, use a paper towel to rub off the skins. Cut the beets into wedges and add them to the bowl with the shallots.Trim the tops and bottoms off the oranges with a paring knife or a small serrated knife. Set the oranges on one of the cut ends and carefully cut away the skins, beginning at the top and following the curve of the fruit down to the bottom. Slice the oranges crosswise into thin slices. Set aside.In a small bowl, whisk together the vinegar, sugar, mustard, some salt and pepper, and the remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil. Pour the dressing over the beets and shallots; toss to combine. Add the mixed greens and the orange slices; toss again. Sprinkle with sunflower seeds.

Add the garlic and 1/2 teaspoon of the salt and cook 2 minutes more. Set aside to cool slightly. In a large bowl, whisk together the gruyere, cream, Parmesan, lemon zest, eggs and the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt.Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the pasta and cook until just tender but still firm to the bite, stirring occasionally, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain, reserving 1 cup of the pasta water. Add the pasta back to the pan along with the onions, cream mixture, 1/4 cup of the reserved pasta water and the pancetta.

Food Network Kitchens suggest caution in consuming raw and lightly cooked eggs due to the risk of Salmonella or other food-borne illness. To reduce this risk, we recommend you use only fresh, properly refrigerated, clean, grade A or AA eggs with intact shells and avoid contact between the yolks or whites and the shell. For recipes that call for eggs that are raw or undercooked when the dish is served, use shell eggs that have been treated to destroy Salmonella, by pasteurization or another approved method.

Stir until smooth. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until thickened.Pour half of the flour mixture into the beaten egg yolks, beating to incorporate. Pour the egg yolk mixture into the pan, mix, and continue cooking for about 10 minutes, stirring and scraping the bottom constantly, until the mixture is thick and coats the back of a spoon.You now have your custard filling. But you have to cool the filling completely before using it. Otherwise, it will create steam and make the pastry shells soggy. So, give the filling an hour or so to cool.Remember to cool the pastry shells too.When both filling and shells have cooled, it’s time to assemble. If you have a pastry bag, fit it with a large tip. Spoon the filling into the bag, poke a hole at the side of a pastry shell and pipe in the filling.If you don’t have a pastry bag, you can split the pastry shells into halves. Spoon the filling on the bottom half then cover with the top half.Then, you garnish your cream puffs. This is an optional stage since the cream puffs are complete after the pastry shells have been filled. But, if you want those little extras…Probably the most common topping is caramelized sugar (see how to caramelize sugar). Just drizzle the caramelized sugar over the cream puffs and your’re done.Or, just sprinkle the cream puffs with powdered sugar.Another option is to melt some chocolate then dip the tops of the cream puffs in it.Which option is best? You decide. Be creative. Those three aren’t the only options, in fact. You can make a sugar glaze, spread it on the cream puffs then decorate with colorful sprinkles — the last option will be especially attractive on the Christmas buffet

You can also line your pan with parchment paper instead of foil. Grease it just in case!Beat eggs at high speed for 5 minutes. Gradually beat in sugar, applesauce, and molasses.Stir together flour, baking powder, cinnamon, allspice, ginger, and salt. Add to other mixture. Spread into pan.Bake at 350F for 10-12 minutes. Turn out immediately onto a kitchen towel sprinkled liberally with powdered sugar. Starting at the narrow end, roll towel and cake together. Cool completely. Note: the cake is soft and spongey. It might come off a little on your fingers, but thats okay. Cooling will take at least 2 hours. You can make the cake a day ahead. Just wrap the cooled cake with plastic wrap overnight.Make the filling: Beat cold heavy whipping cream in a stand mixer with the whisk attachment (or in a large bowl with a hand mixer) until soft peaks form. (This takes about 2 minutes with my stand mixer on medium speed.) Add powdered sugar, vanilla, and eggnog. Continue beating until stiff peaks form. Be careful not to overwhip.Once cake is cool, carefully unroll it. It might leave a little mess on the towel, but thats okay, as long as you can peel it off. Spread about half the whipped cream over the top of the cake, leaving an edge at the end. Starting at the narrow end, re-roll the cake. As you roll it the filling will shift a little and you may need to remove some if youve put too much on the cake. Thats okay, just have a knife handy to scrape off any excess as you roll. At this point you can wrap the cake in plastic wrap and refrigerate for up to 24 hours. When ready, place cake on serving plate and top with some of the remaining whipped cream and dust with cinnamon."},{"vegetarian":false,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":true,"dairyFree":false,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":false,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":22,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":false,"servings":12,"sourceUrl":"http://homemadecravings.com/loaded-fries-and-gorgonzola-steaks-by-the-sea/","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/loaded-fries-596819","aggregateLikes":133,"creditText":"Homemade Cravings","sourceName":"Homemade Cravings","extendedIngredients":[{"id":10123,"aisle":"Meat","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/raw-bacon.jpg","name":"bacon","amount":1,"unit":"Lb","unitShort":"Lb","unitLong":"Lb","originalString":"1 Lb Bacon","metaInformation":[]},{"id":2069,"aisle":"Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/balsamic-vinegar.jpg","name":"balsamic vinegar","amount":1,"unit":"C","unitShort":"C","unitLong":"C","originalString":"1 C Balsamic Vinegar","metaInformation":[]},{"id":1002046,"aisle":"Condiments","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/mustard.jpg","name":"dijon mustard","amount":0.25,"unit":"C","unitShort":"C","unitLong":"Cs","originalString":"1/4 C Dijon Mustard","metaInformation":[]},{"id":11215,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg","name":"garlic cloves","amount":3,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"3 Garlic Cloves Minced","metaInformation":["minced"]},{"id":1011004,"aisle":"Cheese","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/gorgonzola.jpg","name":"gorgonzola cheese","amount":0.25,"unit":"Lb","unitShort":"Lb","unitLong":"Lbs","originalString":"1/4 Lb Gorgonzola Cheese","metaInformation":[]},{"id":4053,"aisle":"Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg","name":"olive oil","amount":12,"unit":"servings","unitShort":"servings","unitLong":"servings","originalString":"Olive Oil","metaInformation":[]},{"id":11353,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/russet-or-Idaho-potatoes.jpg","name":"russet potatoes","amount":5,"unit":"Lbs","unitShort":"Lbs","unitLong":"Lbs","originalString":"5 Lbs Russet Potatoes","metaInformation":[]},{"id":2047,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg","name":"salt and pepper","amount":12,"unit":"servings","unitShort":"servings","unitLong":"servings","originalString":"Salt and Pepper","metaInformation":[]},{"id":1001009,"aisle":"Cheese","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/shredded-cheese-cheddar.png","name":"shredded cheddar cheese","amount":2,"unit":"C","unitShort":"C","unitLong":"Cs","originalString":"2 C Shredded Cheddar Cheese","metaInformation":["shredded"]},{"id":23625,"aisle":"Meat","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sirloin-raw.jpg","name":"sirloin steaks","amount":2,"unit":"Lb","unitShort":"Lb","unitLong":"Lbs","originalString":"2 – 3 Lb Sirloin Steaks","metaInformation":[]},{"id":1056,"aisle":"Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sour-cream.jpg","name":"sour cream","amount":12,"unit":"servings","unitShort":"servings","unitLong":"servings","originalString":"Sour Cream for Serving","metaInformation":["sour","for serving"]},{"id":6971,"aisle":"Condiments","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/dark-sauce.jpg","name":"worcestershire sauce","amount":1,"unit":"TBSP","unitShort":"TBSP","unitLong":"TBSP","originalString":"1 TBSP Worcestershire Sauce","metaInformation":[]}],"id":596819,"title":"Loaded Fries","readyInMinutes":45,"image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Loaded-Fries-596819.jpg","imageType":"jpg","cuisines":["american"],"instructions":"Peel potatoes and slice into large wedges.

Sprinkle with the remaining Parmesan cheese when serving.Mixing the sauce with the pasta is an Italian way to serve up this particular dish. It coats the pasta well, and gives you a delicious bit of sauce in every bite. You do not need to rinse your pasta. Following these directions you can make delicious Alfredo sauce at home."},{"vegetarian":false,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":false,"dairyFree":false,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":false,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":17,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":false,"servings":5,"sourceUrl":"http://www.rachaelray.com/recipe.php?recipe_id=2681","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/pistachio-tarragon-pesto-bowties-with-peas-and-potatoes-18491","aggregateLikes":13,"extendedIngredients":[{"id":11353,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/russet-or-Idaho-potatoes.jpg","name":"baking

non-stick skillet heat soy sauce and butter until the butter is melted. Add chopped mushrooms and cook for about 5 to 7 minutes stirring frequently. Remove from pan and allow to cool on a paper towel-lined plate.Prep vegetables and garlic and add to a large mixing bowl. Add sesame oil, vinegar and salt and pepper. Mix thoroughly with a large spoon. Smash the shrimp with the side your knife and chop. Add to the cabbage mixture and combine.Set up a small bowl of water and wnwrap dumpling wrappers (leaving them in the wrapper but also covering with a wet paper towel to insure they don't dry up) and one at a time, scoop about a teaspoon of filing into the middle of your wrapper. Dab a small spot of water onto the middle top of your dumpling, fold in half and press to seal. Using your thumb and finger, fold pleats into the dumpling on one side and then do the same for the other side. For reference, check out my video on how to wrap potstickers.Repeat until you have no more dumpling wrappers or no more filling.How to Cook the PotstickersI usually make about 8 to 10 at a time to not crowd the pan. Add 1/2 Tablespoon oil to a non-stick skillet and turn heat to medium. Add dumplings to the skillet and cover. Cook for about 2 to 3 minutes. If frozen, add an extra minute. Uncover and add 1/4 cup of water (1/3 cup if frozen) and recover and allow potstickers to steam for about 3 to 4 minutes (4 to 6 minutes if frozen).Serve with soy sauce.Notes:These potstickers definitely freezer friendly. Place uncooked dumplings onto a plate or a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper and freeze for at least 2 hours. Once frozen, they can go into a freezer friendly container or zippered plastic bag."},{"vegetarian":true,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":true,"dairyFree":false,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":false,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":10,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":false,"servings":4,"preparationMinutes":10,"cookingMinutes":15,"sourceUrl":"http://www.foodfaithfitness.com/quinoa-salad-with-kefir/","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/quinoa-salad-with-pistachios-cherries-and-honey-balsamic-kefir-dressing-605700","aggregateLikes":153,"creditText":"Food Faith Fitness","sourceName":"Food Faith Fitness","extendedIngredients":[{"id":2069,"aisle":"Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/balsamic-vinegar.jpg","name":"balsamic vinegar","amount":4,"unit":"tsp","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"4 tsp Balsamic vinegar","metaInformation":[]},{"id":2044,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/basil.jpg","name":"basil","amount":0.25,"unit":"Cup","unitShort":"Cup","unitLong":"Cups","originalString":"¼ Cup + 2 Tbsp Fresh basil, minced","metaInformation":["fresh","minced"]},{"id":93822,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cherries-dried.jpg","name":"dried cherries","amount":0.75,"unit":"Cup","unitShort":"Cup","unitLong":"Cups","originalString":"¾ Cup Reduced-sugar dried cherries, roughly chopped","metaInformation":["dried","roughly chopped","reduced-sugar"]},{"id":1019,"aisle":"Cheese","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/feta-cheese.jpg","name":"feta cheese","amount":1,"unit":"Cup","unitShort":"Cup","unitLong":"Cup","originalString":"1 Cup Reduced-fat feta cheese, crumbled","metaInformation":["crumbled","reduced-fat"]},{"id":19296,"aisle":"Nut butters, Jams, and Honey","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/honey.jpg","name":"honey","amount":4,"unit":"tsp","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"4 tsp Honey","metaInformation":[]},{"id":93611,"aisle":"Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/buttermilk.jpg","name":"kefir","amount":0.5,"unit":"Cup","unitShort":"Cup","unitLong":"Cups","originalString":"½ Cup Plain Lifeway Kefir","metaInformation":["plain"]},{"id":20035,"aisle":"Pasta and Rice","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/uncooked-quinoa.png","name":"quinoa","amount":1,"unit":"Cup","unitShort":"Cup","unitLong":"Cup","originalString":"1 Cup Quinoa, uncooked","metaInformation":["uncooked"]},{"id":2047,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg","name":"salt","amount":0.5,"unit":"tsp","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"½ tsp Salt","metaInformation":[]},{"id":14412,"aisle":"Beverages","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/water.jpg","name":"water","amount":2,"unit":"Cups","unitShort":"Cups","unitLong":"Cups","originalString":"2 Cups Water","metaInformation":[]}],"id":605700,"title":"Quinoa Salad with Pistachios, Cherries, and Honey Balsamic Kefir Dressing","readyInMinutes":25,"image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Quinoa-Salad-with-Pistachios--Cherries--and-Honey-Balsamic-Kefir-Dressing-605700.jpg","imageType":"jpg","cuisines":[],"instructions":"In a large pot, bring 2 cups of water to a boil.

into very small pieces by cutting the thighs into strips with a very sharp knife, then turn and cut against the strips into tiny pieces. Lay them out and sprinkle with salt and pepper.In a large heavy bottomed fry pan over high heat, place one tablespoon of the oil. When smoking hot, swirl around the pan and add half the chicken pieces. Make sure you drop the pieces in a little at a time so they are separated. If you put them in the pan in a pile and try to spread them out, they will start to steam and will not sear. Cook these for a few minutes to brown one side and with a spatula, flip and cook the other side for one minute (dont worry about turning every single piece). Transfer this to a bowl.Heat the pan back up with the second tablespoon of oil and cook the second half of the chicken once the pan is smoking hot. Remove that batch to the same bowl.Reduce the burner to medium high and heat the last of the oil. Add onions and all five peppers and saut for about three minutes until just tender.Add all of the herbs and spices, the water, tomato paste, cilantro and cooked chicken with any liquid from the bowl and cook stirring often over medium heat for about five minutes to thicken and meld the flavors.Remove from heat and serve with your choice of soft or hard taco shells and toppings."},{"vegetarian":true,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":true,"dairyFree":true,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":false,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":1,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":false,"servings":6,"preparationMinutes":20,"cookingMinutes":0,"sourceUrl":"http://www.thisgalcooks.com/2014/05/13/cucumber-noodles-spicy-sesame-soy-dressing/","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/cucumber-noodles-+-spicy-sesame-soy-dressing-542591","aggregateLikes":108,"creditText":"This Gal Cooks","sourceName":"This Gal Cooks","extendedIngredients":[{"id":11124,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/carrots.jpg","name":"carrot","amount":2,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"2 large carrot, peeled","metaInformation":["large","peeled"]},{"id":11165,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cilantro.png","name":"cilantro","amount":6,"unit":"servings","unitShort":"servings","unitLong":"servings","originalString":"Cilantro for garnish","metaInformation":["for garnish"]},{"id":11206,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cucumber.jpg","name":"cucumbers","amount":3,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"3 medium to large cucumbers","metaInformation":["medium to large"]},{"id":11216,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ginger.jpg","name":"fresh ginger","amount":1,"unit":"tsp","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoon","originalString":"1 tsp fresh grated ginger","metaInformation":["fresh","grated"]},{"id":11215,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg","name":"garlic","amount":1,"unit":"clove","unitShort":"clove","unitLong":"clove","originalString":"1 clove of garlic","metaInformation":[]},{"id":19296,"aisle":"Nut butters, Jams, and Honey","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/honey.jpg","name":"honey","amount":1,"unit":"tsp","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoon","originalString":"1 tsp honey","metaInformation":[]},{"id":9160,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/lime-juice.jpg","name":"juice of lime","amount":6,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"Juice from half a lime","metaInformation":[]},{"id":93830,"aisle":"Ethnic Foods","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vinegar-(white).jpg","name":"mirin","amount":0.5,"unit":"tbsp","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoons","originalString":"½ tbsp mirin","metaInformation":[]},{"id":1032009,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/red-pepper-flakes.jpg","name":"red pepper flakes","amount":6,"unit":"servings","unitShort":"servings","unitLong":"servings","originalString":"Red pepper flakes for garnish","metaInformation":["red","for garnish"]},{"id":4058,"aisle":"Ethnic Foods","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sesame-oil.jpg","name":"sesame oil","amount":1,"unit":"tbsp","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoon","originalString":"1 tbsp sesame oil","metaInformation":[]},{"id":16124,"aisle":"Ethnic Foods","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/soy-sauce.jpg","name":"soy sauce","amount":0.5,"unit":"C","unitShort":"C","unitLong":"Cs","originalString":"½ C soy sauce","metaInformation":[]},{"id":1016168,"aisle":"Condiments","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/hot-sauce-or-tabasco.png","name":"sriracha","amount":2,"unit":"tsp","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"1 - 2 tsp sriracha","metaInformation":[]}],"id":542591,"title":"Cucumber Noodles + Spicy Sesame Soy Dressing","readyInMinutes":20,"image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Cucumber-Noodles-+-Spicy-Sesame-Soy-Dressing-542591.jpg","imageType":"jpg","cuisines":[],"instructions":"Using a julienne peeler, slice the cucumbers.

Watch how to make this recipe.                                                        For the casserole: Preheat the oven to 375degrees F. Butter a 13- by 9-inch ovenproof dish or lasagna dish and set aside.Cook the egg noodles in salted boiling water according to package directions for al dente, about 8 minutes. Drain and immediately place the noodles in a large bowl filled with ice water to stop the cooking. Once cooled, drain and then pour the pasta into a large bowl with the tuna, peas and both cheeses. Toss to combine.In a large pan with straight sides, add the 2 tablespoons butter, the olive oil, onions and thyme. Season with a sprinkle of salt and pepper and cook on medium heat until the onions are tender and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the mushrooms, season with salt and cook gently until tender and darkened, about 5 minutes more. Add the Worcestershire sauce and horseradish, and then sprinkle the flour over the entire pan. Stir to help the flour soak into the vegetables and cook a minute more to lose the flour taste. Raise the heat to medium-high and add the chicken stock. Cook until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes, and then slowly stir in the heavy cream. Simmer until the cream is thickened slightly, about 4 minutes more. Taste and season with salt if needed. Pour the mushroom sauce over the prepared noodles in the large bowl and quickly stir to combine. Immediately pour into the prepared dish.For the topping: In a small bowl, combine the breadcrumbs and olive oil. Season with a sprinkle of salt and a grind or two of pepper. Stir until the crumbs soak up the oil evenly. Sprinkle the breadcrumb mixture evenly over the top of the dish and place, uncovered, in the oven until the sides are bubbly and the top is golden brown, about 35 minutes. Let it rest 5 minutes before serving.

While the berries are simmering away, start on the rice pudding. Pour the rice into a large pan, along with the milk and sugar. Bring to the boil, then turn the heat down low and cook until the rice is creamy and tender. This should take about 10-15 minutes. Make sure you stir it regularly, so it doesn't stick.

on a rack in a large pot. Add enough water to cover the jars, and bring to boil over high heat. Boil for 10 minutes, then turn off heat and allow the jars to rest in the hot water. Meanwhile, put bands and lids in a small saucepan and cover with water.

Wipe rims of the jars, cover with lids, and screw bands on until just barely tight. Place jars on rack in pot and cover completely with water. Cover pot and bring to a boil over high heat. Boil for 15 minutes. Turn off heat, uncover pot, and allow jars to rest in water for five minutes. Remove jars from pot and allow them to rest undisturbed on countertop for six hours or

step.) Bring a small pan of water to a boil and toss in pearl onions, skin and all. Boil covered for three minutes and drain. Plunge into ice water to cool. On a cutting board, cut off root end of onion and squeeze the other end. A perfect pearl onion will pop out. Repeat for all of the onions and discard the skins and roots.In a medium to large pot, place pearl onions, stock, carrots, potatoes, thyme, parsley, salt, pepper, nutmeg, mustard powder, Worcestershire sauce and Tabasco sauce. Bring to a boil and simmer 10-15 minutes until vegetables are tender.Preheat oven to 425 degrees.While vegetables are cooking, in a small pan, melt butter and add flour. Stir and cook over low heat about 4-5 minutes or until the raw flour smell is gone. Set aside.Once the vegetables are tender, remove from heat and add the cream, peas, turkey and optional leftover vegetables. Add butter flour mixture and stir with a wooden spoon until sauce is thick and creamy. Taste and adjust seasoning if needed.Pour mixture into a 3-quart casserole dish or pan.Open up the sheets of pie dough and use one or two that will cover the shape of the casserole dish or pan but don't cover it yet. Using a cookie cutter in the shape of a turkey, fall leaf, acorn or other fall shape, make the cut in the center of the pie. If you are using a wide pan, pinch the two pieces of dough together to fit the shape of the pan and make your cut in the center. Any leftover dough can be baked separately along with the decorative cutouts (see optional step below).Place the dough over the pie and crimp the sides to make a decorative border.Beat the egg with a teaspoon of water and brush onto the dough tops including the cut outs and extra dough. Then sprinkle the sugar all over the tops, sticking to the egg wash.Place the pie in the center of the oven (you may want to place a piece of foil under the dish in case the sauce bubbles over) and bake 25 to 30 minutes until the crust is golden and the pie is bubbling. Remove and let set for ten minutes before serving.Optional step: On a separate sheet pan, place the cut outs and extra crust and bake for 10-12 minutes until golden. These pieces will take less than half the time to cook as the covered pie does. Depending on how creative you are and how much crust you have, you could serve each finished portion of pie with a decorative shape."},{"vegetarian":true,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":false,"dairyFree":false,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":false,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":26,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":false,"servings":3,"preparationMinutes":30,"cookingMinutes":80,"sourceUrl":"http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchens/broccoli-and-red-onion-quiche-recipe.html","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/broccoli-and-red-onion-quiche-747667","aggregateLikes":102,"creditText":"Foodnetwork","sourceName":"Foodnetwork","extendedIngredients":[{"id":11156,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/green-onion.jpg","name":"chives","amount":1,"unit":"tablespoons","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoon","originalString":"1 to 2 tablespoons chopped chives","metaInformation":["chopped"]},{"id":1123,"aisle":"Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg","name":"eggs","amount":3,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"3 large eggs","metaInformation":["large"]},{"id":1053,"aisle":"Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/fluid-cream.jpg","name":"heavy cream","amount":1.25,"unit":"cups","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"1 1/4 cups heavy cream, half-and-half or milk","metaInformation":[]},{"id":1082047,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg","name":"kosher salt","amount":3,"unit":"servings","unitShort":"servings","unitLong":"servings","originalString":"Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper","metaInformation":["freshly ground"]},{"id":9156,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/zest-lemon.jpg","name":"lemon zest","amount":0.5,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"1/2 teaspoon paprika or chile powder, or some grated lemon zest (optional)","metaInformation":["grated"]},{"id":11282,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-onion.jpg","name":"onions","amount":0.25,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"1/4 to 1/2 cup sauteed sliced red onions","metaInformation":["red","sliced"]},{"id":1025,"aisle":"Cheese","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pepper-jack-cheese.jpg","name":"pepper jack cheese","amount":0.75,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"3/4 to 1 cup shredded pepper jack cheese","metaInformation":["shredded"]},{"id":10018338,"aisle":"Frozen","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/dough.jpg","name":"pie dough","amount":3,"unit":"servings","unitShort":"servings","unitLong":"servings","originalString":"Store-bought or homemade pie dough","metaInformation":["homemade","store-bought"]},{"id":12135,"aisle":"Nuts","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/nuts-mixed.jpg","name":"roasted nuts","amount":0.25,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"1/4 to 1/2 cup chopped roasted or steamed broccoli","metaInformation":["steamed","chopped"]}],"id":747667,"title":"Broccoli and Red Onion Quiche","readyInMinutes":110,"image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/broccoli-and-red-onion-quiche-747667.jpeg","imageType":"jpeg","cuisines":["mediterranean","european","french"],"instructions":"Directions                                                        Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.

While you're waiting for it, take a large bowl and rub the inside of it with the cut side of the other half of your garlic clove. Drain your orzo and place it (warm) into the bowl. Add a good glug of olive oil, then the arugula, chickpeas, lemon juice, salt & pepper, and toss. Taste and adjust seasonings.Dice your avocado and season it with a squeeze of lemon and a bit of salt.Place the orzo salad onto a serving plate (or just keep it in the same bowl). Take the tomatoes and drain out most of the liquid at the bottom of their bowl (this will keep your salad from becoming too watery). Find that smashed garlic clove and remove it.

                                               Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.Bring a large pot of water to a boil. When it comes to a boil, salt the water and cook angel hair pasta to al dente, 5 minutes.Heat 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, 3 turns of the pan, in a large nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. Add onions and gently cook 5 minutes. Do not caramelize the onions just let them get translucent and sweet. Add celery, garlic and olives and season with paprika, salt, and pepper. Stir in mustard and hot sauce. Beat together the eggs and 1/4 cup of the cream (eyeball it) and pour into the pan. Stir in the parsley and let the eggs settle and form a foundation, as you would for an omelet. Transfer the pan to the oven and bake until golden, 12 minutes or so. Garnish with the paprika after you remove the frittata from the oven.Heat the remaining extra-virgin olive oil in a deep skillet over medium heat, 2 turns of the pan. Add shallots and cook 5 minutes. Add zest and wine then reduce a minute or so more. Add the remaining 1/2 cup cream, reduce 2 minutes. Add 2 ladles of starchy cooking water from the pasta to the sauce pot just before draining. Toss pasta with cheese and season with salt and pepper. Transfer pasta to a bowl and garnish with a large amount of fresh basil. Yum-o!

sauté pan on medium high heat.  Add the zucchini, onions, garlic, green chiles, and jalapeño to the pan.  Sprinkle with salt and cumin.  Stir to coat the vegetables with the oil in the pan.  Spread the veggies out in the pan and then stir only occasionally, until they are all lightly browned.  Stir in the chopped tomatoes and oregano, lower the heat to low.  Let gently cook for several minutes while you are preparing the tortillas.2 You are going to want to heat up the tortillas first, first to soften them, and then to melt the cheese.  There are two basic ways of doing this.  One way is on the stove top, preferably in a cast iron pan.  Another way is to use the microwave. In both methods you will work in batches. (A third way is to use fresh homemade corn tortillas, which is a great option if you are set up for it.)  2a Preparing tortillas on the stove-top Heat a dollop of olive oil (or other vegetable oil) in a large cast iron frying pan, on medium high. Add a tortilla to the pan, moving it around a bit, and turning it over, so that it spreads around the oil.  Let the tortilla heat until it develops little bubbles of air pockets.  Then place a piece of cheese on one side of the tortilla, and use a metal spatula to fold the other side of the tortilla over the cheese.  Heat until cheese is melted, then remove from pan.  Note that if you have a big enough pan, you can have one tortilla folded over while you have another tortilla doing its initial heating. 2b Preparing tortillas in the microwave Place a paper towel (or half a paper towel) on the heating surface of your microwave.  Spread out 2 tortillas on the paper towels.  Cook on high heat for 20 seconds per tortilla, in the case of 2 tortillas, 40 seconds.  The tortillas should develop air pockets.  (Note that every microwave is a little different, and corn tortillas differ as well. So you may need to adjust the times for your particular setup.) Then place a slice of cheese on one side of each tortilla and fold the tortillas over the cheese.  Cook for an additional 10 seconds per tortilla (20 seconds for 2 tortillas), or until the cheese is melted. 3 Open the tacos and spoon some of the cooked veggie filling into them.  Sprinkle on chopped cilantro and crumbled cotija cheese.  Serve immediately."},{"vegetarian":true,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":false,"dairyFree":false,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":false,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":4,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":false,"servings":48,"preparationMinutes":40,"cookingMinutes":15,"sourceUrl":"http://diethood.com/2012/12/03/ginger-snap-cookies-cream-cheese-frosting/","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/ginger-snap-cookies-with-lemon-cream-cheese-frosting-566458","aggregateLikes":103,"creditText":"Diethood","sourceName":"Diethood","extendedIngredients":[{"id":18372,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg","name":"baking soda","amount":0.5,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"1/2 teaspoon baking soda","metaInformation":[]},{"id":1001,"aisle":"Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg","name":"butter","amount":1.5,"unit":"sticks","unitShort":"sticks","unitLong":"sticks","originalString":"1 1/2 sticks of butter, room temperature","metaInformation":["room temperature"]},{"id":1017,"aisle":"Cheese","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cream-cheese.jpg","name":"cream cheese","amount":4,"unit":"ounces","unitShort":"oz","unitLong":"ounces","originalString":"4 ounces cream cheese (half package), room temperature","metaInformation":["room temperature","(half package)"]},{"id":10019334,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-sugar-dark.jpg","name":"dark brown sugar","amount":0.5,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"1/2 cup dark brown sugar","metaInformation":["dark"]},{"id":1123,"aisle":"Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg","name":"egg","amount":1,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"1 egg","metaInformation":[]},{"id":20081,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png","name":"flour","amount":2,"unit":"cups","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"2 cups all-purpose flour","metaInformation":["all-purpose"]},{"id":2010,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cinnamon.jpg","name":"ground cinnamon","amount":2,"unit":"teaspoons","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"2 teaspoons ground cinnamon","metaInformation":[]},{"id":2011,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cloves.jpg","name":"ground cloves","amount":0.5,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"1/2 teaspoon ground cloves","metaInformation":[]},{"id":2021,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ginger.jpg","name":"ground ginger","amount":2,"unit":"teaspoons","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"2 teaspoons ground ginger","metaInformation":[]},{"id":12311111,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/lemon-oil.png","name":"lemon extract","amount":0.125,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"1/8 teaspoon lemon extract","metaInformation":[]},{"id":19304,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/molasses.png","name":"molasses","amount":0.25,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"1/4 cup molasses","metaInformation":[]},{"id":19336,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/powdered-sugar.jpg","name":"powdered sugar","amount":1.5,"unit":"cups","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"1 1/2 cups powdered sugar","metaInformation":[]},{"id":2047,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg","name":"salt","amount":0.25,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"1/4 teaspoon salt","metaInformation":[]},{"id":2050,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla-extract.jpg","name":"vanilla extract","amount":1,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoon","originalString":"1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract","metaInformation":["pure"]},{"id":19335,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg","name":"white sugar","amount":0.5,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"1/2 cup white sugar","metaInformation":["white"]}],"id":566458,"title":"Ginger Snap Cookies with Lemon Cream Cheese Frosting","readyInMinutes":60,"image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Ginger-Snap-Cookies-with-Lemon-Cream-Cheese-Frosting-566458.jpg","imageType":"jpg","cuisines":[],"instructions":"In a large mixing bowl cream together the butter and both sugars until light and fluffy.Add in the molasses, egg, and vanilla extract;

Set aside to cool.In a small bowl, beat the cream until it thickens and stiff peaks form (when you pull the beaters straight up, peaks will form but not fall over). Set aside.In a large mixing bowl, beat together the sugar and cream cheese until smooth and creamy, about 2-3 minutes. Scrape down the bowl as needed. Beat in the vanilla.Fold the whipped cream into the cream cheese mixture. Set aside.Dust a dry, flat surface with enough flour to roll out the puff pastry. Roll it out into a 12×12 square. Cut the dough into four equal squares.In a small bowl, beat the egg. Take one square, brush the edges with some of the egg. Spread about 1/4 of the cheesecake filling into the middle then top with 1-2 tablespoons of pie filling (don't overfill), being careful not to get too close to the edge. Take one of the corners and fold it diagonally to the other corner, forming a triangle. Press the edges together to seal. Place the turnover on the cookie sheet. Repeat with the remaining squares. If you have any leftover filling, refrigerate it for another time.After all four are on the sheet, cut two slits into each one. Brush them with the beaten egg. Discard any leftover egg. Sprinkle with cinnamon sugar mixture. Bake for 18-20 minutes or until golden brown and puffed. Let cool.In a small bowl, whisk together the sugar, milk, and vanilla. Drizzle on top of each turnover. Let sit for a few minutes while the glaze hardens."},{"vegetarian":true,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":true,"dairyFree":false,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":true,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":5,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":false,"servings":36,"sourceUrl":"http://www.loveandoliveoil.com/2014/03/old-fashioned-fudge.html","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/old-fashioned-fudge-494037","aggregateLikes":5020,"creditText":"Love and Olive Oil","sourceName":"Love and Olive Oil","extendedIngredients":[{"id":1049,"aisle":"Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/fluid-cream.jpg","name":"half and half","amount":1.5,"unit":"cups","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"1 1/2 cups half and half","metaInformation":[]},{"id":19350,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/corn-syrup.jpg","name":"light corn syrup","amount":2,"unit":"tablespoons","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoons","originalString":"2 tablespoons light corn syrup","metaInformation":["light"]},{"id":2047,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg","name":"salt","amount":0.5,"unit":"teaspoon","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"1/2 teaspoon salt","metaInformation":[]},{"id":19335,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg","name":"sugar","amount":3,"unit":"cups","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"3 cups sugar","metaInformation":[]},{"id":1145,"aisle":"Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg","name":"unsalted butter","amount":0.25,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"1/4 cup (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, cut into pieces","metaInformation":["unsalted","cut into pieces","(1/2 stick)"]},{"id":19165,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cocoa-powder.jpg","name":"unsweetened cocoa","amount":0.75,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa","metaInformation":["unsweetened"]},{"id":2050,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla-extract.jpg","name":"vanilla extract","amount":1,"unit":"tablespoon","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoon","originalString":"1 tablespoon vanilla extract","metaInformation":[]}],"id":494037,"title":"Old-Fashioned Fudge","readyInMinutes":150,"image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Old-Fashioned-Fudge-494037.jpg","imageType":"jpg","cuisines":[],"instructions":"Line an 8-inch square baking pan with parchment paper or aluminum foil.

Let stand, without disturbing, until mixture cools to 130ºF.Add vanilla and beat mixture by hand or with a hand mixer until thickened and shine just barely begins to disappear. This can take quite a while so you may want an extra set of arms ready.

Preheat the grill to medium heat.Mix the ground beef, heavy cream, Worcestershire and the salt and some pepper in a bowl. Use your hands to thoroughly mix the ingredients. Form 1/4 cup of the meat mixture into patties, making 16 patties total. Make an indentation with your thumb to keep the patties from plumping too much when they cook.Grill the sliders until just cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Remove from the grill and pile on a platter.Toast the halved buns on the grill. Place the sliders between the buns and serve immediately.

Remove from the pan and cut into bite-size pieces.In a separate pan, cook the onions in the butter over a low heat until caramelized, 20 to 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.Use a fork to crumble the gorgonzola.Put the bacon, caramelized onions and crumbled gorgonzola into separate bowls.

Spoon a sixth of the vegetables in a line on the top third of the wrapper.Fold over the top of the wrapper and press well down all round.

About 30 minutes before you want to cook, put the tomatoes in a bowl and season them with salt, pepper, and sugar. Set aside.2. Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C). Using a sharp, thin-bladed knife, make small 1/2-inch-deep slits all over the pork loin. Slide a garlic sliver into each slit using the edge of the knife. Season the pork all over with salt and pepper.3. Heat the olive oil in a large, heavy-bottomed ovenproof pot over medium-high heat. Add the pork and brown on all sides, about 4 minutes per side. Remove the pork from the pot and set aside.4. Pour off all but 2 tablespoons of oil from the pot. Add the onion and halved garlic cloves and cook slowly, stirring often, until caramelized, 12 to 15 minutes. Add the wine, bring to a boil over high heat, and cook for 2 minutes. Add the reserved tomatoes, thyme, marjoram, and crushed red pepper. Stir in the clam juice and cook over high heat for 2 to 3 minutes.5. Spread the vegetables evenly over the bottom of the pot and rest the pork loin on top of the vegetables. Transfer it to the oven and roast, basting every 10 to 15 minutes, until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the loin reads between 145°F and 150°F (62°C and 65°C), about 45 minutes, for medium; or 160°F (70°C) for more well done. Transfer the pork to a cutting board, cover with aluminum foil, and set aside.6. Put the pot over medium heat. Add the clams, cover, and cook until the clams pop open, 5 to 6 minutes.7. While the clams are cooking, carve the loin into individual chops and arrange decoratively on a platter. When the clams are done, arrange them over and around the chops.8. To serve, spoon some sauce around the platter and scatter the chopped parsley over the pork and vegetables. Serve family style from the center of the table."},{"vegetarian":false,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":false,"dairyFree":false,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":false,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":31,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":false,"servings":4,"sourceUrl":"http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2012/05/refrom-lamb-cutlets.html","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/reform-lamb-cutlets-breaded-lamb-chops-with-ham-201007","aggregateLikes":12,"creditText":"Serious

Add port and vinegar and cook until almost totally reduced, about 2 minutes, then add stock, bay leaves and thyme, bring to a simmer and reduce by half, about 20 minutes.                                                                                                                            2                                                                            Mix cornstarch with 2 tablespoons water and add to simmering sauce; once sauce has thickened, season to taste with salt and pepper.                                                                                                                            3                                                                            For the Lamb: Place rib chops on a cutting board, and using a mallet, gently flatten each chop until it is 1/2 inch thick.

(If you happen to stir in fresh or frozen fruit, the added moisture will necessitate an extra minute or two of bake time. If you do this, I recommend no more than 1/4-1/3 cup of fruit.  Too much moisture will create a mushy end result.)Conversely, microwave for 1 minute 45 seconds to 2 1/2 minutes, or until the top of the oatmeal is slightly firm to the touch.

whisking together the flour, salt, pepper and nutmeg in a large bowl. In a separate small bowl, beat the pumpkin puree, eggs and buttermilk until well combined. Add the egg mixture to the flour, and using a wooden spoon or spatula, gently stir together until you have a sticky dough. Depending on your puree and eggs, you may find that your dough is too thick. If that is the case, add a little more milk or water, about a tablespoon at a time, until the sticky dough is on the thin side, almost like a thick pancake batter. Let the dough sit in the refrigerator while you bring some water to a boil. This can even be done the night before.Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Using a spaetzle maker or colander, pass the dough through the holes and drop it into the water. The dumplings will cook quickly and float to the top. Use a slotted spoon to retrieve the spaetzle. Set aside in a colander to drain.Make the browned butter sauce by melting the butter in a saute pan over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook the sauce, stirring, for about 5-7 minutes, until the butter is golden brown. Skim any foam from the sauce and discard. Stir in the spaetzle and parsley,and season with salt and pepper. Toss in a generous sprinkling of parmesan cheese and transfer to a serving dish. Serve while hotwith shavings ofparmesan cheese."},{"vegetarian":false,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":false,"dairyFree":false,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":false,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":9,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":false,"servings":4,"preparationMinutes":20,"cookingMinutes":20,"sourceUrl":"http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchens/arugula-citrus-salad-with-pork.html","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/arugula-citrus-salad-with-pork-733059","aggregateLikes":129,"creditText":"Foodnetwork","sourceName":"Foodnetwork","extendedIngredients":[{"id":11959,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/arugula-or-rocket-salad.jpg","name":"baby arugula","amount":8,"unit":"cups","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"1 5 -ounce package baby arugula (about 8 cups)","metaInformation":[]},{"id":18242,"aisle":"Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/croutons.jpg","name":"croutons","amount":0.75,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"3/4 cup fat-free croutons (any flavor), crushed","metaInformation":["fat-free","crushed","(any flavor)"]},{"id":20081,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png","name":"flour","amount":0.25,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"1/4 cup all-purpose flour","metaInformation":["all-purpose"]},{"id":4703,"aisle":"Condiments","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/mustard.jpg","name":"honey mustard","amount":1,"unit":"tablespoon","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoon","originalString":"1 tablespoon honey mustard","metaInformation":[]},{"id":1082047,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg","name":"kosher salt","amount":4,"unit":"servings","unitShort":"servings","unitLong":"servings","originalString":"Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper","metaInformation":["freshly ground"]},{"id":4641,"aisle":"Condiments","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/mayonnaise.jpg","name":"light mayonnaise","amount":5,"unit":"tablespoons","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoons","originalString":"5 tablespoons light mayonnaise","metaInformation":["light"]},{"id":9202,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/mandarin-or-tangerines-or-clementines.jpg","name":"navel oranges","amount":5,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"5 large navel oranges","metaInformation":["large"]},{"id":4053,"aisle":"Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg","name":"olive oil","amount":1,"unit":"tablespoon","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoon","originalString":"1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil","metaInformation":["extra-virgin"]},{"id":1033,"aisle":"Cheese","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/parmesan-or-romano.jpg","name":"parmesan cheese","amount":3,"unit":"tablespoons","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoons","originalString":"3 tablespoons grated parmesan cheese","metaInformation":["grated"]},{"id":10062,"aisle":"Meat","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pork-loin-chops.png","name":"pork loin chops","amount":1,"unit":"pound","unitShort":"lb","unitLong":"pound","originalString":"4 boneless center-cut pork loin chops (about 1 pound), trimmed","metaInformation":["boneless","trimmed"]},{"id":10011282,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/red-onion.jpg","name":"red onion","amount":1,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"1 red onion, thinly sliced","metaInformation":["red","thinly sliced"]},{"id":6971,"aisle":"Condiments","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/dark-sauce.jpg","name":"worcestershire sauce","amount":1,"unit":"tablespoon","unitShort":"T","unitLong":"tablespoon","originalString":"1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce","metaInformation":[]}],"id":733059,"title":"Arugula-Citrus Salad with Pork","readyInMinutes":40,"image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/arugula-citrus-salad-with-pork-733059.jpeg","imageType":"jpeg","cuisines":[],"instructions":"Directions                                                        Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.

bacon starts to turn crisp but not hard and brittle. Remove from pan, drain bacon and set aside. Spread butter lightly on one side of the flour tortilla shell. Place buttered side of shell down, into a non-stick fry pan that has been preheated on medium heat. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of bacon over entire shell, then add 1 Tbs. Pico de Gallo, and 1/4 cup shredded Colby/Monterey Jack cheese over the bacon. Place the second flour shell on top of fixings, buttered side up. Cook for about one - two minutes just long enough to heat the inside ingredients and then carefully flip the quesadilla on the other side and finish cooking. The quesadilla should be heated through but not browned. Remove quesadilla and place on a serving dish and cut into individual triangle serving pieces.

medium saucepan of well-salted water over medium-high heat. While the water comes to a boil, set up a bowl of ice water next to the stove.When the water reaches a boil, add the Thai basil leaves and blanch for 20 seconds to set the color and let them wilt. Drain the Thai basil and immediately plunge into the ice water to stop the cooking process. Remove the leaves and squeeze them dry.Put the Thai basil leaves in a blender with the mayonnaise, salt, and ice cube and blend until smooth.For the burgers: Preheat a grill or grill pan over high heat. Cut both meats into cubes and place in a food processor with the salt. Pulse until ground—you want the meat to be chopped but you don’t want it to lose its texture or get tough.Form into 4 patties, make them firm so they don’t fall apart during cooking.Brush the patties on both sides with the glaze. Place over the hottest part of the grill and cook until they release easily from the grill, then turn over, brush with more glaze, and continuing cooking.Cooking time will be about 3 minutes per side for very rare and another minute per side for each increasing stage of doneness. When the burgers are done, brush them again with the glaze.Meanwhile, toast the buns and place each bun open on a plate.

(If your pork chops are very thin and have cooked through at this point, skip the oven step and tent them loosely with aluminum foil while making the sauce.)2 Add the minced onion to the sauté pan in which you browned the pork, and sauté for 2-3 minutes, until the onion begins to brown. Add the vinegar, chili powder, pepper, maple syrup, water, and Worcestershire sauce to the pan and bring to a boil. Pour this sauce over the pork chops in the baking dish. Lower the heat to 350°F and bake uncovered for 10-15 minutes for thick (1-inch thick) chops, 5-10 minutes for thin (1/2-inch thick) chops, or until the interior of the pork reaches 145°F.3 Optional In the same sauté pan that you used to make the sauce, add a little oil and heat to medium high.  Cook the sliced onions in the pan, allowing the onions to pick up any sauce remaining in the pan.

Squeeze or bruise them to release oils. Place them in a jar along with the garlic.Heat the oil to warm (no more than 160 degrees F) and pour into the jar.Let cool to room temperature. Cover and set in a dark place (cabinet or pantry). Remove garlic after 2 days. Use within 3 weeks.Make sure all the fresh herbs have been rinsed and dried (I use a salad spinner to spin-dry).Cut the stems from the parsley and cilantro below the leaves (to have mostly only leaves left).Place the parsley, cilantro, oregano, thyme, rosemary, vinegar, red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper in the bowl of a food processor fitted with a knife blade.Pulse a few times to chop the herbs. Scrape down the sides of the bowl. Pulse while drizzling in the olive oil. Do not over-process or it will become a paste.Transfer the chimichurri sauce to a small bowl. Stir in additional olive oil for desired consistency. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper to taste.Serve immediately or cover and refrigerate overnight. Recommended to make a day ahead for flavors to develop.Cut the bottom stems from the parsely and cilantro. Finely chop the parsley, cilantro, and oregano.Place all the herbs and the garlic infused olive oil in a bowl. Stir to combine. Add the shrimp and toss to coat. Marinate for 20 minutes.Heat a grill to medium-high heat.Strip all but the top 2 to 4 inches of needles from the rosemary branches. Whittle or cut the end to make a point.Skewer the shrimp on the rosemary branches. Season with salt and pepper.Grill the shrimp until they are just cooked through, about 2 minutes per side.Serve the shrimp skewers with chimichurri sauce."},{"vegetarian":false,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":true,"dairyFree":true,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":false,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":9,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":true,"servings":4,"sourceUrl":"http://www.foodista.com/recipe/LJ8B3NK7/bacon-wrapped-pork-tenderloin","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/bacon-wrapped-pork-tenderloin-633344","aggregateLikes":55,"creditText":"Foodista.com – The Cooking Encyclopedia Everyone Can Edit","license":"CC BY 3.0","sourceName":"Foodista","extendedIngredients":[{"id":10123,"aisle":"Meat","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/raw-bacon.jpg","name":"bacon","amount":6,"unit":"slices","unitShort":"slices","unitLong":"slices","originalString":"6 slices of bacon","metaInformation":[]},{"id":1002030,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pepper.jpg","name":"black pepper","amount":4,"unit":"servings","unitShort":"servings","unitLong":"servings","originalString":"freshly ground black pepper","metaInformation":["black","freshly ground"]},{"id":2047,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg","name":"coarse salt","amount":4,"unit":"servings","unitShort":"servings","unitLong":"servings","originalString":"coarse salt","metaInformation":[]},{"id":2038,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sage.jpg","name":"fresh sage","amount":10,"unit":"leaves","unitShort":"leaves","unitLong":"leaves","originalString":"10 leaves fresh sage","metaInformation":["fresh"]},{"id":1022020,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic-powder.jpg","name":"garlic powder","amount":1,"unit":"pinch","unitShort":"pinch","unitLong":"pinch","originalString":"1 pinch garlic powder","metaInformation":[]},{"id":10218,"aisle":"Meat","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pork-tenderloin-raw.png","name":"pork tenderloin","amount":2,"unit":"pounds","unitShort":"lb","unitLong":"pounds","originalString":"2 pounds pork tenderloin","metaInformation":[]}],"id":633344,"title":"Bacon Wrapped Pork Tenderloin","readyInMinutes":45,"image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Bacon-Wrapped-Pork-Tenderloin-633344.jpg","imageType":"jpg","cuisines":[],"instructions":"<ol><li>Remove about an inch off the tapered end of each tenderloin to make a perfect cylinder.</li><li>Season with salt, pepper, and a pinch of garlic powder.</li><li>Lay the bacon strips in a overlapping line on a sheet of cling wrap.

The donuts will still be warm and fragile, but this allows the cinnamon sugar to stick well.  Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.  Wipe the donut pan and fill with batter again and repeat process.  For the eyes, I melted the chocolate chips in a ziploc bag and cut off the corner to pipe small circles.  For \"blood\", squeeze 2 dots of red gel onto each donut.  Close the teeth together in your fingers and squeeze them into the center of each donut.  I found the pressure from the hinge started to break apart some of the donuts, so I ended up clipping the teeth in half so they weren't actually separated.

Lightly dust both sides of each slice with a few pinches of smoked paprika, rubbing the piquant spice into the surface of the cheese.Preheat your grill and brush the grate with oil. Once the grill is hot, set each slice of cheese onto the grate. Allow each slice to grill for about one minute, or just until the edges begin to get melty. Gently flip the cheese over with the tongs, grilling the other side of the slices. Cook for one more minute, then remove the slices from the grill and set on a plate.Top each slice with a small spoonful of tapenade and garnish with chopped parsley. Serve immediately, while hot.Method for Olive Tapenade: Add all ingredients to a small food processor and pulse until the tapenade is finely chopped. Pop open the lid of the processor and taste.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F, and line a cake pan with a round of parchment paper on the bottom.Sift together the cocoa powder, flour, malted milk powder, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Set it aside.Whisk the egg, vegetable oil, sugar, buttermilk, vanilla, and hot espresso like heck for a good 30 seconds until foamy and bubbly on top. Add this mixture to the dry ingredients, whisking JUST until the flour disappears (no overstirring allowed. You'll make the cake tough).Pour the batter into the cake pan and bake for about 25-30 minutes until the interior reaches 200 degrees F, but hey, since we're crumbling it up anyway, just use a knife to peek into the middle and see if it's done. And a quick note: the cake/brownie will puff up a ton and then sink in the middle. This is normal.Remove the cake from the pan and let it cool on a wire rack. Time to work on the buttercream.The buttercream is made in the same way as my French Almond Buttercream. In a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat the egg yolks on high speed for 10 minutes until they are very pale. In the meantime, combine the sugar and water in a heavy bottomed saucepan over medium heat, and let the sugar syrup simmer to the soft ball stage (238 degrees on an instant read thermometer).When both the egg yolks and the sugar syrup are ready, pour the sugar syrup into the mixing bowl (the mixer should still be on high speed), aiming as best as you can to pour between the wire whisk and the side of the bowl. Dump in the malted milk powder. Now if you touch the bottom of the bowl, it will be very hot. Beat the egg yolk sugar mixture until the bowl feels neither hot nor cold (about 5 minutes).Turn the mixer down to medium and add the butter, a couple cubes at a time to the bowl, over the course of 10 minutes. Wait until each installment of butter is absorbed until you add the next batch.Melt the chocolate in the microwave or in a double boiler (if you don't know how to do this, see my chocolate article). Add the melted chocolate to the buttercream and mix until the chocolate is distributed. Refrigerate the buttercream until it's cold.To assemble the cake truffles: Crumble up the cooled cake with your fingertips. Add about 1/3 of the buttercream and mix until distributed. If the cake is not sticky enough, you can add a tbsp or two more to the cake, but don't make the cake truffles too wet. Portion out little scoops of the truffle mixture with a cookie scoop and roll into a ball between the palms of your hands. Roll in the chocolate shavings, and refrigerate until they firm up. They will taste best the next day when the flavors have melded together, just make sure to store in an airtight container so they don't dry out.

Heat on high for 1 minute, then remove and stir. Continue heating in 20 second intervals, pausing after each to stir, until the butter is melted and the milk is warm to the touch but not hot. If needed, let the milk mixture sit for a few minutes until it is warm but not hot.In a separate bowl, whisk together 3 cups flour (not all of the flour), sugar and salt until combined.In the bowl of a stand mixer (*see note below for an alternative method of making this by hand*) fitted with the dough hook attachment, add yeast and lukewarm milk mixture and stir by hand to combine. Add the flour mixture and egg, and beat on medium-low speed until combined. If the dough is sticking to the sides of the bowl, add the remaining flour, 1/4 cup at a time, until the dough begins to form a ball and pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Continue beating for 5 minutes on medium-low speed. Remove the dough hook and cover the dough with a damp towel and let rest for 10 minutes.Meanwhile, make your filling by whisking together sugars and cinnamon in a bowl until combined.When the dough is ready, turn it out onto a floured work surface. Then use a floured rolling pin to roll the dough out into a large rectangle, about 14 x 9 inches in size. (If you want all edges to be even, you can use a pizza slicer to cut the dough into a perfect rectangle.) Use a knife or pastry spatula to spread the softened 1/2 cup of butter out evenly over the entire surface of the dough. Then sprinkle evenly with the cinnamon and sugar mixture.Beginning at the 14-inch edge, tightly roll up the dough. And then give the final seam a little pinch so that it seals. Use a piece of dental floss* to \"cut\" off the two ends of the roll (an inch on each end - discard that dough) so that they are even. Then cut the remaining dough into 11 or 12 equal pieces. (11 rolls seem to fit in a pie plate, while 12 rolls fit in a rectangular pan.) (*To cut dough with dental floss, simply break off a piece of floss about 12 inches long. Then very carefully slide the middle of the floss under the dough to the place where you want to \"cut\". Then pull the ends of the floss up and cross over the top of the dough. Then give a quick tug to literally cut all the way through the dough. This is the best method for not squishing your dough while cutting it -- although the standard knife method still works too.)Place each of the cut cinnamon rolls into a greased pie plate or 9 x 13-inch baking dish. Then cover again with a damp towel, and leave the dish in a warm place to rise for 25 minutes. While the dough is rising, make the icing (instructions below).When the rolls have risen, uncover the dish. Then place on the center rack of the oven and bake at 350 degrees F for 15-20 minutes, or until the rolls are golden and cooked through. Remove and let cool on a wire rack for at least 5 minutes. Drizzle with your desired icing and serve.Either in the bowl of an electric stand mixer, or a mixing bowl, whisk softened butter and cream cheese together until combined. Then whisk in powdered sugar until combined. If the icing is too thick, add a tablespoon or two of milk to thin. Whisk together butter, vanilla and powdered sugar until combined. If the icing is too thick, add a tablespoon or two of milk to thin. If the icing is too thin, add a tablespoon or two of powdered sugar to thicken."},{"vegetarian":true,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":true,"dairyFree":false,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":true,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":16,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":false,"servings":6,"preparationMinutes":10,"cookingMinutes":20,"sourceUrl":"http://www.foodfaithfitness.com/black-bean-power-burger-avocado-crema/","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/black-bean-power-burger-with-avocado-crema-783892","aggregateLikes":467,"creditText":"Food

                 For the sauce:                                        To make the meatballs: In a large bowl, mix together all the ingredients, except the canola oil. Shape heaping teaspoons of the mixture into 1-inch balls. In a Dutch oven, heat a tablespoon of oil over medium-high heat. Working in batches, wiping pan in between, saute the meatballs, turning frequently for even browning, until cooked through, about 4 to 5 minutes. Place on a paper towel-lined plate.                                                To make the sauce:                                        Heat oil in the same Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the onions and saute until golden brown, about 8 minutes. Add the crushed red pepper and cook 1 minute. Stir in the remaining ingredients and reduce heat to low.Add the browned meatballs to the Dutch oven and toss gently to coat with sauce.

prepare the torte: Preheat your oven to 350°F. Butter and flour a 9-inch springform pan, dusting off the excess. Process the roasted almonds, almond extract and 1 tablespoon of the sugar in a food processor until the nuts are completely pulverized. Transfer to a bowl and toss with the flour.Melt the chocolate on top of a double boiler over hot water, stirring constantly. Remove the melted chocolate from the heat and set aside.Using a hand mixer, cream the butter at medium speed until pale yellow, about 3 minutes. Add the remaining sugar and vanilla extract and continue creaming until the mixture is very light. Add the egg yolks one at a time, making sure each one is completely incorporated into the mixture before adding the next one. Add the melted chocolate and stir well to combine. Stir in the almond mixture and again, combine well.In another bowl beat the egg whites with the hand mixer until stiff, then fold them into the batter with a rubber spatula until combined.Bake for about 40 minutes (25 min if using convection) or until a cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool the torte on a wire rack, removing the springform rim after a few minutes. Let cool completely before adding the frosting.To prepare the frosting: Melt the remaining 8 ounces chocolate in a double boiler and set aside to cool to lukewarm. Beat the heavy cream in a bowl with a hand mixer until it's stiff, adding the scant teaspoon of superfine sugar after a minute of mixing. Start the mixer at lower speed, increasing as you go. The cream will get quite stiff after just 3-4 minutes and you want to stop just as the texture resembles that of soft butter. You can stop sooner than this but I found that the frosting held up better this way. Fold the lukewarm chocolate into the whipped cream and spread on top of the torte. You can serve immediately but I found that this torte tasted even better chilled the next day."},{"vegetarian":false,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":true,"dairyFree":true,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":false,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":29,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":true,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":false,"servings":2,"sourceUrl":"http://www.americastestkitchenfeed.com/recipes/homemade-duck-prosciutto/","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/homemade-duck-prosciutto-57648","aggregateLikes":13,"extendedIngredients":[{"id":2004,"aisle":"Spices

Dutch-oven, add the corned beef (fat side up), seasoning packet, bay leaves, garlic cloves, thyme, and pepper. Pour enough water to completely submerge the corned beef. Bring to a boil, cover, and cook for 60-80 minutes per pound. Half way during the cooking process, you may need to add enough water to keep it covered.Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line a roasting pan with aluminum foil. Place the fully cooked corned beef fat side up in the pan. Place in the oven and roast for 45 minutes to an hour or until the fat is nice and crisp.

Add mushrooms and shallots and sauté about 5 minutes (if using chanterelles, dry sauté first for a minute or two and let the mushrooms cook in their own juices before adding the butter).  Add the rice and stir to combine. 3 Add brandy, bring to a boil, and reduce liquid by half, about 3-4 minutes. Add simmering stock, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring enough to keep the rice from sticking to the edges of the pan. Stir the rice almost constantly — stirring sloughs off the starch from the rice, making the creamy sauce you're looking for in a risotto.

Cook the pieces in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat until the skin is crisped and some of the fat has been released, about 5 minutes. Transfer the kielbasa to a paper towel-lined plate to cool.Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.On a lightly floured surface, roll one piece of puff pastry out to form an 8- by 11-inch rectangle. Using a 3 1/2-inch round cookie cutter, cut out 6 circles from the pastry; cut the circles out as close together as possible and reserve the scraps. Repeat with the second sheet of puff pastry.Wrap a circle of puff pastry around each of a kielbasa, pinching the seams together to seal all the way around so no kielbasa is exposed and gently pulling on the ends to make a tapered football shape. Place on an ungreased baking sheet, seam-side down, and repeat with the remaining pastry and sausage.Brush the rolled sausages with the beaten egg. Use bits of the pastry scraps to make laces on each \"football\" by placing 1 strip lengthwise on top of each and laying 3 smaller strip crosswise over it. Press down gently to adhere and brush the laces with a bit more egg.Bake until the pastry is browned and crisped, 25 to 30 minutes. Serve the pigskins with mustard for dipping.

Sear the steak for 3 mins on the first side until well browned, basting with the oil and herbs as it cooks. Carefully tip off the oil, add another 2 tbsp, then sear the second side of the steak in the same way. Quickly brown around the edges, then slide the pan into the oven and roast for 15 mins, turning over halfway through.Take the steak from the pan and sit it on a rack over a roasting tin. Tip the oil, herbs and garlic from the pan over the steak, then leave to rest for 15-20 mins. Leave the steak uncovered – covering with foil will make the steak steam and lose its crisp crust.Meanwhile, start the hollandaise. Put a medium pan of water on to boil. Put the vinegar, basil stalks, bay leaf and spices into a small pan. Boil down to about 3 tbsp, then strain. Put the egg yolks into a large, deep bowl, add 1 tbsp cold water and 1 tbsp of the vinegar reduction, then whisk briefly until light and frothy.Put the bowl over, but not touching, the simmering water, then whisk to a light, airy foam. Now gradually add the butter, little by little, whisking all the time to make a silky yellow sauce. Prevent the sauce overheating by lifting the bowl on and off the pan, adding a splash more water if it starts to get too thick. The sauce can be kept warm for up to 30 mins by sitting the bowl in a bath of just-warm water. If it gets too hot, the sauce will split. Just before serving, finely chop the basil and stir into the sauce with the lemon juice and seasoning to taste.HOLLANDAISE TIP: This recipe makes enough reduction for threebatches of sauce – keep what’s left over in thefridge for several months. We make huge batchesin our restaurants, reducing to 100ml, adding alittle water and storing in a squeezy bottle. Leftover hollandaise will keep well in thefridge for up to 2 days. Try stirring it through somemash to top a fish pie."},{"vegetarian":true,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":true,"dairyFree":false,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":false,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":16,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":false,"servings":1,"sourceUrl":"http://www.bakeyourday.net/baked-elvis-oatmeal/","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/healthy-baked-elvis-oatmeal-552548","aggregateLikes":231,"creditText":"Bake Your Day","sourceName":"Bake Your Day","extendedIngredients":[{"id":9040,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/bananas.jpg","name":"banana","amount":0.5,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"1/2 banana, sliced or mashed","metaInformation":["mashed","sliced"]},{"id":12006,"aisle":"Health Foods","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chia-seeds.jpg","name":"chia seeds","amount":1,"unit":"tsp","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoon","originalString":"1 tsp. chia seeds","metaInformation":[]},{"id":2010,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cinnamon.jpg","name":"cinnamon","amount":1,"unit":"tsp","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoon","originalString":"1 tsp. cinnamon","metaInformation":[]},{"id":10116098,"aisle":"Nut butters, Jams, and Honey","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/peanut-butter.jpg","name":"creamy peanut butter","amount":2,"unit":"Tbs","unitShort":"Tbs","unitLong":"Tbs","originalString":"2 Tbs. creamy natural peanut butter","metaInformation":[]},{"id":19296,"aisle":"Nut butters, Jams, and Honey","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/honey.jpg","name":"honey","amount":1,"unit":"Tbs","unitShort":"Tbs","unitLong":"Tb","originalString":"1 Tbs. honey","metaInformation":[]},{"id":1077,"aisle":"Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/milk.jpg","name":"milk","amount":2,"unit":"Tbs","unitShort":"Tbs","unitLong":"Tbs","originalString":"2 Tbs. milk","metaInformation":[]},{"id":8120,"aisle":"Cereal","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/rolled-oats.jpg","name":"oats","amount":0.5,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"1/2 cup oats","metaInformation":[]},{"id":2047,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg","name":"salt","amount":0.125,"unit":"tsp","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"1/8 tsp. salt","metaInformation":[]},{"id":2050,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla-extract.jpg","name":"vanilla","amount":1,"unit":"tsp","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoon","originalString":"1 tsp vanilla","metaInformation":[]}],"id":552548,"title":"Healthy Baked Elvis Oatmeal","readyInMinutes":45,"image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Healthy-Baked-Elvis-Oatmeal-552548.jpg","imageType":"jpg","cuisines":[],"instructions":"Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Bake the potatoes until soft, about 1 hour.Meanwhile, in a large soup pot, brown the bacon over medium heat. Add the carrots, celery and onions. Season with salt and pepper and cook until the vegetables are translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the chicken, thyme and broth; bring to a simmer and skim any foam that rises to the top. Reduce the heat and barely simmer until the chicken is cooked through, about 40 minutes. Discard the thyme. Remove the chicken and let cool. Pull off the meat and shred into bite-sized pieces; cover and set aside. Season the broth with salt and pepper.Melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add the breadcrumbs and cook, stirring, until toasted, about 3 minutes; set aside. Halve the baked potatoes and scoop the flesh into a bowl; mash with a fork and season with salt and pepper. Sift the flour over the potatoes and add the toasted crumbs, parmesan and nutmeg; lightly knead to make a firm dough. Roll into 1/2-inch-wide cylinders; cut into 1/2-inch pieces and round the edges to make oval-shaped gnocchi. Bring the soup to a boil and drop in the gnocchi.

Let set, about 30 seconds. Stir in the chicken meat, parsley, basil and spinach; season with salt and pepper. Ladle the soup over the gnocchi.
