  "instructions": "Add parsley, garlic, lemon juice, cumin and a healthy pinch each salt and pepper to a food processor and mix to combine.Add chickpeas and pulse until incorporated but still slightly chunky. You want to maintain a bit of texture.Transfer to a mixing bowl and add nut meal (or oat flour) and mix again until a loose dough is formed that's firm enough to be handled. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed. I added a touch more salt.Draw an x in the dough to form 4 sections, then use your hands to form into 4 large patties roughly 1/2-inch thick.Place on a foil-lined baking sheet and refrigerate or freeze for 15 minutes to firm up. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F in the meantime.OPTIONAL STEP: For a little extra crust on the outside, before baking heat a large skillet over medium to medium-high heat and add 2 Tbsp olive or canola oil. Swirl to coat pan, then add falafel. Carefully flip once golden brown  about 3-4 minutes - and then cook on the other side until golden brown as well - 3-4 more minutes. Return to baking sheet to continue baking. Otherwise, just add them straight to the oven for baking.Bake for a total of 30-40 minutes, flipping once at the halfway point for even cooking. The longer you bake them, the firmer theyll get!Serve warm wrapped in a pita or chard bun and desired sauces / toppings. Alternatively, serve atop a salad and use the garlic sauce as a dressing.Burgers will store in the fridge, layered with parchment paper in an airtight container, for several days. Freeze to keep longer.",
