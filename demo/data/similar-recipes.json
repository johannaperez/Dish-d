    "instructions": "Slice Eggplant to 1/3 inch thick pieces and sprinkle each side with salt. Let sit for 30 min or up to 1 hour. Eggplant will begin to sweat, releasing some of its bitterness. Rinse well, Drain, pat dry.  Pre-heat grill, to med-high. Slice tomatoes to 1/2 inch thick. Brush both sides with olive oil, place on baking sheet. Slice halloumi into 1/2 inch thick pieces, brush with olive oil, place on the same baking sheet. Pat dry eggplant and brush both sides generously with olive oil, place on backing sheet.Make dressing. Blend all ingredients in a blender or food processor...adding a little more water  (only if necessary) to get the blender going. Do not blend too smooth... you want to see pieces of the herbs.Grill eggplant slices, covering grill, checking heat to make sure they don't burn, rotating as necessary. Eggplant is done when the white becomes slightly translucent. Stack them on a heat proof dish and cover tightly with foil so they continue cooking through. You could place this on your upper grill rack if you have one, or just set aside, covered.  Grill tomato slices, just a few minutes on each side. If you grill too long, they will fall apart, so just a couple minutes, just to warm them is enough.Grill the Halloumi cheese just until grill marks appear.Arrange all on a platter, layering drizzle with the dressing and a sprinkle of salt and pepper, and garnish with fresh mint leaves. Serve at room temp. If you want to serve this Napoleon Style- a stacked individual portion, layer eggplant, tomato, and haloumi spooning a little mint dressing on each layer, until 4-5 inches tall. Skewer with a skewer or sturdy rosemary sprig ( removing bottom rosemary leaves).",

The outside should be just cooked while the inside is still raw.Once cooked on all sides, set the tuna aside, or in the fridge to chill.For the dressing – place the cilantro, salsa, lime juice, olive oil, and stevia in a food processor or blender, and pulse until you get a dressing consistency.Assemble the salad. Place the lettuce and sprouts on a plate. Slice the tuna into thin slices and layer with the avocado over the lettuce. Pour the dressing over the tuna and avocado.Enjoy!",

    "instructions": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.Rinse the quinoa in a fine sieve, then drain excess water. Place the drained quinoa in a frying pan over medium heat. It will take the water a few minute to evaporate, then as the quinoa dries, it will begin to toast. Stir periodically until the quinoa is evenly browned and gives off a lovely nutty aroma. Set aside 1/4 cup of the toasted quinoa.Place the remaining 3/4 cup quinoa and 1 cup water in a saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat. Lower the heat to a simmer, and cook for about 10 minutes. Cover and let the quinoa sit for 5 minutes more. The water should be fully absorbed. Drain any excess water if necessary.While the quinoa cooks and cools, prepare the artichokes. Fill a large bowl with cool water, then squeeze the juice of two lemons into the water, and drop the lemons into water, as well. Remove the outer leaves of the artichoke by snapping them off, until you are left with the tender leaves within. Cut about 1 1/2 inches off the tops of the artichoke, then remove the purple choke inside by scooping it out with a spoon. Trim the stems of the artichoke, then peel the tough outer layer of the stem. Place the artichokes in the lemon water bath. Repeat with remaining artichokes.In a medium bowl, combine the cooked quinoa, feta, parmesan, garlic, shallot, cilantro and parsley. Stir in the olive oil and toss to evenly coat the stuffing. Stuff the artichokes well with the stuffing, topping it with some of the reserved toasted quinoa, and place in a baking dish. Drizzle with a little olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Add a little water to the baking dish, cover with aluminum foil and bake the artichoke for about 45 minutes, or until a knife inserted into the artichoke heart shows that it is tender and fully cooked. Remove the foil and continue baking for 5 minutes more.Serve immediately.",

Reduce heat to medium and add the tomato paste, cumin, cinnamon, and chilies. Cool until the spices become fragrant, 1-2 minutes. Add the white wine and cook 2-3 minutes until the liquid decreases slightly. Add tomato, onion, garlic, pepper, bay leaves, and beef broth, and bring to a boil.Simmer covered, until meat is tender (about 1 1/2- 2 hours). Remove the meat to a platter. Pick out the bay leaf and red chilies, and discard. Remove the garlic bulb, squeeze out as much garlic as you like, and discard the papery skin. In a food processor or blender, pure?e the sauce and return it to the stockpot. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Pour your fragrant sauce over the meat and uncork a lovely bottle of Rioja.

    "instructions": "1. Measure the flour into a large bowl; set aside. Combine the water, olive oil, yeast, sugar and salt in a large, 4-cup measuring cup or in a small bowl, mixing to dissolve the yeast. Pour the water mixture over the flour and mix with a wooden spoon until all of the flour is moistened. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for a minute or two, adding additional flour or water if the dough it is too sticky or dry, until soft and just slightly tacky. Place the dough in a well-oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and place in a draft-free area until doubled in size (this can take anywhere from 1 to 3 hours).2. Line three baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats and set aside. Working on a pastry mat or clean counter or table, oil the surface, your hands and a rolling pin. Divide the dough into two. Take the first half and gently press down on it, flipping it over and doing the same, to release gasses and flatten it. Using the rolling pin or your hands, shape the dough into a rectangle measuring about 5 inches by 16 inches, and ½-inch thick. Using a pizza cutter, slice the rectangle into 5-inch by ¾-inch strips.3. Sprinkle the strips with flour. Taking the strips one at a time, gently roll it back and forth to create an even rope. Tie it into a knot and place on a prepared baking sheet. Place the knots about 1½ inches apart. Continue to make the rest of the knots and repeat process with the second piece of dough. Cover the baking sheets with a dry kitchen towel or cheesecloth and place in a warm, draft-free area to rise. The rolls should double in size during the second rise.4. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.5. Once the knots have doubled in size, remove the towel covering them and bake, one pan at a time, for 12 to 15 minutes, or until golden.6. While the knots are baking, prepare the garlic coating. Over low heat, warm the olive oil, butter and garlic in a small saucepan. Add the chopped parsley, cover and set aside.7. After removing the knots from the oven and while they are still warm, either brush them with the garlic coating, or place the knots in a large bowl and toss with the garlic coating. Season with additional sea salt to taste.8. Serve warm or at room temperature. Baked rolls can be individually wrapped and frozen in an airtight freezer bag. Rewarm in a 350 degree F oven for about 5 minutes.",

    "instructions": "To roast the cauliflower: Preheat oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit. Toss cauliflower florets with enough olive oil to cover them in a light, even layer of oil. Season with salt and pepper and arrange the florets in a single layer on a large, rimmed baking sheet. Roast for 30 to 35 minutes, tossing halfway, until the florets are deeply golden on the edges.To cook the freekeh: Warm 1 tablespoon olive oil in a heavy-bottomed saucepan. Add the almonds and cook, stirring occasionally, until it's fragrant and turning golden on the edges, about 3 minutes. Add the freekeh and saut for 2 minutes, then add the garlic, cumin, coriander and salt, and saut for 1 more minute. Add vegetable broth, raise the heat and bring the mixture a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover and cook, stirring occasionally and reducing heat as necessary to maintain a gentle simmer, until freekeh is tender to the bite, 20 to 25 minutes. Drain off any excess liquid, cover and set aside for 5 minutes. Fluff with a fork and season with salt and pepper to taste.To make the dressing: In a bowl, stir together the tahini, lemon juice, garlic and red pepper flakes. Whisk in the water until you have a smooth, blended tahini sauce. Season generously with salt and black pepper, to taste.To assemble the individual dishes: Start with a bed of cooked freekeh and top with roasted cauliflower. Drizzle tahini sauce generously over the dish and then top with a sprinkling of chopped fresh herbs, crumbled feta (optional), raisins and sesame seeds. Serve immediately. Leftovers are best stored as individual components and assembled after reheating the freekeh and cauliflower.",
